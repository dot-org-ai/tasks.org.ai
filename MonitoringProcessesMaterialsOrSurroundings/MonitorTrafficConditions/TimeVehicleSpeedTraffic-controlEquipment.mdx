# Time Vehicle Speed Traffic-control Equipment

> Business-as-Code definition for timing vehicle speed and traffic-control equipment operation. Provides speed measurement, timing synchronization, and traffic control optimization for intelligent transportation management.

## Overview

Timing vehicle speed and traffic-control equipment involves precise measurement of vehicle velocities, synchronization of traffic signals, and coordination of traffic control devices to optimize traffic flow and safety. This definition exposes timing actions, speed monitoring capabilities, and event-driven alerts for adaptive traffic management systems.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { timeVehicleSpeedTrafficControlEquipment } from '@headlessly/time-vehicle-speed-traffic-control-equipment'

const timing = timeVehicleSpeedTrafficControlEquipment()

// Measure vehicle speed
await timing.measureSpeed({
  location: 'Main St between 5th and 6th Ave',
  equipmentId: 'RADAR-MAIN-001',
  speedLimit: 35,
  captureInterval: 'continuous'
})

// Synchronize traffic signals
await timing.synchronizeSignals({
  corridor: 'Main Street Corridor',
  signals: ['SIG-MAIN-5TH-001', 'SIG-MAIN-6TH-001', 'SIG-MAIN-7TH-001'],
  strategy: 'green-wave',
  targetSpeed: 35,
  direction: 'northbound'
})

// Optimize timing based on traffic patterns
await timing.optimizeTiming({
  equipmentId: 'SIG-MAIN-5TH-001',
  adjustments: {
    peakHours: { cycleLength: 120, greenTime: { northbound: 45, eastbound: 35 } },
    offPeakHours: { cycleLength: 90, greenTime: { northbound: 35, eastbound: 25 } }
  }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on speed violations
timing.violationDetected(async ({ location, measuredSpeed, speedLimit }) => {
  const excessSpeed = measuredSpeed - speedLimit

  if (excessSpeed > 15) {
    await notify({
      to: 'speed-enforcement',
      message: `Significant speed violation at ${location}: ${measuredSpeed} mph in ${speedLimit} mph zone`,
      action: 'dispatch-officer'
    })
  }
})

// Auto-adjust timing during high-speed periods
timing.speedMeasured(async ({ location, averageSpeed, speedLimit }) => {
  if (averageSpeed > speedLimit * 1.2) {
    await timing.optimizeTiming({
      location,
      adjustment: 'reduce-green-time',
      reason: 'excessive-speed-detected'
    })
  }
})

// Schedule calibration on timing analysis
timing.timingAnalyzed(async ({ equipmentId, metrics }) => {
  if (metrics.accuracy < 0.95 || metrics.lastCalibration > 180) {
    await timing.calibrateEquipment({
      equipmentId,
      priority: 'scheduled',
      reason: 'routine-maintenance'
    })
  }
})
```
