# Monitor Student Behavior Social Development

> Business-as-Code definition for student behavioral and social development monitoring. Tracks social-emotional learning, peer interactions, and behavioral patterns to support whole-child education and early intervention.

## Overview

Student behavior and social development monitoring involves systematic observation of social-emotional competencies, peer relationships, and conduct patterns to identify strengths and concerns. This definition provides actions for developmental tracking, events for intervention triggers, and searches for trend analysis. Used in K-12 schools, early childhood programs, and special education settings to support positive development and address behavioral health needs.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { monitorStudentBehaviorSocialDevelopment } from '@headlessly/monitor-student-behavior-social-development'

const development = monitorStudentBehaviorSocialDevelopment()

// Observe student social interaction
await development.observeBehavior({
  studentId: 'student-456',
  context: 'playground-recess',
  observation: 'Successfully resolved conflict with peer using words',
  skills: ['conflict-resolution', 'verbal-communication'],
  positive: true
})

// Assess social-emotional development
const assessment = await development.assessDevelopment({
  studentId: 'student-456',
  period: 'semester',
  domains: ['self-awareness', 'relationship-skills', 'responsible-decision-making']
})

// Identify developmental concern
await development.identifyConcern({
  studentId: 'student-789',
  concern: 'social-withdrawal',
  severity: 'moderate',
  indicators: ['isolated-during-lunch', 'avoids-group-work', 'limited-peer-interaction']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Engage parent when concern identified
development.concernIdentified(async ({ studentId, concern, severity }) => {
  if (severity === 'moderate' || severity === 'high') {
    await development.engageParent({
      studentId,
      method: 'conference',
      purpose: `discuss ${concern}`,
      urgency: severity === 'high' ? 'immediate' : 'routine'
    })
  }
})

// Develop plan for recurring concerns
development.concernIdentified(async ({ studentId, concern }) => {
  const history = await development.getConcerns({
    studentId,
    timeframe: 'year'
  })
  if (history.filter(c => c.type === concern).length >= 3) {
    await development.developPlan({
      studentId,
      focus: concern,
      team: ['teacher', 'counselor', 'parent']
    })
  }
})
```
