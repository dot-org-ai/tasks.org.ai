## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { monitorPatronActivitiesIdentifyProblems } from '@headlessly/monitor-patron-activities-identify-problems'

const monitoring = monitorPatronActivitiesIdentifyProblems()

// Observe patron behavior
await monitoring.observePatron({
  patronId: 'patron-456',
  location: 'reading-room',
  activity: 'using-computers',
  notes: 'Patron appears frustrated with equipment'
})

// Identify issue needing attention
await monitoring.identifyIssue({
  patronId: 'patron-456',
  issue: 'technical-difficulty',
  description: 'Unable to access online catalog',
  severity: 'low'
})

// Provide assistance
await monitoring.provideAssistance({
  patronId: 'patron-456',
  staffId: 'staff-789',
  assistance: 'login-help',
  outcome: 'resolved'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-dispatch staff for identified issues
monitoring.issueIdentified(async ({ patronId, issue, location }) => {
  const severity = await monitoring.assessSeverity({ patronId, issue })
  if (severity.level === 'medium' || severity.level === 'high') {
    await dispatchStaff({
      location,
      issue,
      priority: severity.level
    })
  }
})

// Escalate to security for high severity
monitoring.severityAssessed(async ({ patronId, issue, level }) => {
  if (level === 'high' || level === 'critical') {
    await monitoring.escalateToSecurity({
      patronId,
      issue,
      urgency: 'immediate',
      location: await getPatronLocation(patronId)
    })
  }
