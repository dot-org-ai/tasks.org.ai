## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { superviseSchoolStudentActivities } from '@headlessly/supervise-school-student-activities'

const supervision = superviseSchoolStudentActivities()

// Schedule supervision for field trip
const assignment = await supervision.scheduleSupervision({
  activityId: 'field-trip-123',
  supervisorId: 'teacher-456',
  date: '2026-03-15',
  timeSlot: { start: '09:00', end: '15:00' },
  location: 'Science Museum'
})

// Record student attendance
await supervision.takeAttendance({
  activityId: 'field-trip-123',
  presentStudents: ['student-1', 'student-2', 'student-3'],
  absentStudents: ['student-4']
})

// Document behavioral observation
await supervision.recordObservation({
  activityId: 'field-trip-123',
  studentId: 'student-2',
  observation: 'Demonstrated exceptional leadership during group activity',
  timestamp: '2026-03-15T11:30:00Z'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify parents of incidents
supervision.incidentReported(async ({ incident }) => {
  if (incident.severity === 'minor' || incident.severity === 'major') {
    await notify({
      to: incident.studentId.parentEmail,
      subject: 'Incident Report',
      message: `An incident occurred during ${incident.activityName}`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-escalate serious incidents
supervision.incidentReported(async ({ incident }) => {
  if (incident.severity === 'major') {
    await supervision.escalateIssue({
      incidentId: incident.id,
      escalatedTo: 'principal',
      reason: 'Major incident requiring administrative review'
    })
  }
})
```
