## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { enforceRulesPoliciesGoverningStudent } from '@headlessly/enforce-rules-policies-governing-student'

const conduct = enforceRulesPoliciesGoverningStudent()

// Document a violation
await conduct.documentViolation({
  studentId: 'student-789',
  policyCode: 'CONDUCT-03',
  violation: 'disruptive-behavior',
  location: 'classroom-B12',
  reportedBy: 'teacher-456',
  description: 'Repeatedly interrupted instruction after warnings'
})

// Investigate incident
await conduct.investigateIncident({
  incidentId: 'incident-123',
  witnesses: ['teacher-456', 'student-012'],
  evidence: ['classroom-video', 'teacher-statement']
})

// Assign consequence
await conduct.assignConsequence({
  violationId: 'violation-123',
  consequence: 'detention',
  duration: '2-hours',
  date: '2026-02-10',
  educationalComponent: 'behavior-reflection-worksheet'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-notify parent on violation
conduct.violationDocumented(async ({ studentId, violation, severity }) => {
  await conduct.notifyParent({
    studentId,
    method: severity === 'high' ? 'phone' : 'email',
    content: {
      violation,
      nextSteps: 'conference-scheduled'
    }
  })
})

// Develop intervention plan for repeat offenses
conduct.consequenceAssigned(async ({ studentId, violationId }) => {
  const history = await conduct.findViolations({
    studentId,
    timeframe: 'semester'
  })
  if (history.length >= 3) {
    await conduct.developPlan({
      studentId,
      type: 'behavioral-intervention',
      team: ['counselor', 'teacher', 'parent']
    })
  }
})
```
