## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { monitorStudentPerformance } from '@headlessly/monitor-student-performance'

const performance = monitorStudentPerformance()

// Record quiz grade
await performance.recordGrade({
  studentId: 'student-456',
  assignment: 'unit-3-quiz',
  subject: 'mathematics',
  score: 85,
  maxScore: 100,
  standards: ['8.EE.A.1', '8.EE.A.2']
})

// Assess mastery of learning standards
const mastery = await performance.assessMastery({
  studentId: 'student-456',
  standards: ['8.EE.A.1', '8.EE.A.2', '8.EE.A.3'],
  period: 'quarter-2'
})

// Track semester progress
const progress = await performance.trackProgress({
  studentId: 'student-456',
  subject: 'mathematics',
  period: 'semester-1'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Assign intervention when struggle identified
performance.struggleIdentified(async ({ studentId, subject, severity }) => {
  if (severity === 'moderate' || severity === 'high') {
    await performance.assignIntervention({
      studentId,
      type: severity === 'high' ? 'intensive-tutoring' : 'small-group',
      subject,
      frequency: severity === 'high' ? 'daily' : 'twice-weekly'
    })
  }
})

// Communicate progress on milestone achievement
performance.milestoneAchieved(async ({ studentId, goal }) => {
  await performance.communicateProgress({
    studentId,
    recipients: ['parent'],
    message: `${goal} mastered`,
    method: 'email'
  })
})
```
