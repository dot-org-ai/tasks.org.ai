```typescript
import { monitorPerformanceOrganizationalMembersPartners } from '@headlessly/monitor-performance-organizational-members-partners'

const performance = monitorPerformanceOrganizationalMembersPartners()

// Track quarterly sales metric
await performance.trackMetric({
  memberId: 'employee-456',
  metric: 'quarterly-sales',
  value: 285000,
  target: 300000,
  period: 'Q1-2026'
})

// Assess goal progress
const assessment = await performance.assessGoals({
  memberId: 'employee-456',
  period: 'Q1-2026'
})

// Conduct annual review

performance.gapIdentified(async ({ memberId, gap, severity }) => {
  if (severity === 'medium' || severity === 'high') {
    await performance.createPlan({
      memberId,
      focus: gap,
      duration: '90-days',
      milestones: await generateMilestones(gap)
    })
  }
})

// Alert leadership when partner underperforms
performance.goalsAssessed(async ({ partnerId, achievement }) => {
  if (achievement < 0.7 && isPartner(partnerId)) {
    await notify({
      to: 'partnership-coordinator',
      message: `Partner ${partnerId} at ${achievement * 100}% of target`,
