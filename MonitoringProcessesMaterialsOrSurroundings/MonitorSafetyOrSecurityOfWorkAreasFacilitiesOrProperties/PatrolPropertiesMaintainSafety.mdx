# Patrol Properties Maintain Safety

> Business-as-Code definition for property safety patrols. Models the systematic physical inspection of buildings, grounds, and perimeters to deter crime, identify hazards, and maintain a safe environment for occupants and visitors.

## Overview

Property patrolling involves security personnel making scheduled or random rounds through buildings, parking structures, grounds, and perimeter fencing to detect unauthorized activity, safety hazards, and maintenance issues. Officers verify that doors are secured, lighting is functional, fire exits are unobstructed, and no suspicious persons or conditions are present. This definition covers patrol scheduling, checkpoint verification, incident documentation, and escalation procedures.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { patrolPropertiesMaintainSafety } from '@headlessly/patrol-properties-maintain-safety'

const patrol = patrolPropertiesMaintainSafety()

// Start an evening patrol round
const round = await patrol.beginPatrol({
  officerId: 'SEC-087',
  routeId: 'ROUTE-EVENING-BLDG-A',
  startTime: '2026-02-05T22:00:00Z',
  propertyId: 'PROP-RIVERSIDE-PLAZA'
})

// Scan a checkpoint and record observations
await patrol.scanCheckpoint({
  patrolId: round.id,
  checkpointId: 'CP-PARKING-LEVEL-3',
  status: 'secure',
  notes: 'All lights functional, no vehicles after hours, gate locked'
})

// Report a discovered incident
await patrol.reportIncident({
  patrolId: round.id,
  type: 'vandalism',
  location: 'Building A, stairwell B, floor 2',
  description: 'Broken window in stairwell door, glass debris on landing',
  severity: 'medium'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-generate maintenance request when incidents involve property damage
patrol.incidentReported(async ({ patrolId, type, location, description }) => {
  if (['vandalism', 'water-leak', 'structural-damage'].includes(type)) {
    await patrol.requestMaintenance({
      patrolId,
      location,
      description: `Patrol finding: ${description}`,
      priority: 'urgent'
    })
  }
})

// Alert supervisor when checkpoints are missed
patrol.patrolCompleted(async ({ patrolId, routeId }) => {
  const missed = await patrol.getMissedCheckpoints({ patrolId })
  if (missed.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'shift-supervisor',
      message: `Patrol ${patrolId} missed ${missed.length} checkpoints on route ${routeId}`
    })
  }
})
```
