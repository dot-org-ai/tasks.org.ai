# Patrol Natural Areas Ensure Safety

> Business-as-Code definition for natural area patrol operations. Models the systematic patrolling of parks, forests, wildlife refuges, and other natural areas to ensure public safety, enforce environmental regulations, and protect natural resources.

## Overview

Patrolling natural areas involves traversing designated territories on foot, by vehicle, or by watercraft to maintain public safety and enforce land-use regulations. Rangers and conservation officers monitor for illegal activities such as poaching and unauthorized logging, respond to visitor emergencies, and assess environmental conditions including wildfire risk and trail hazards. This definition covers patrol planning, execution, incident documentation, and regulatory enforcement across managed natural lands.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { patrolNaturalAreasEnsureSafety } from '@headlessly/patrol-natural-areas-ensure-safety'

const patrol = patrolNaturalAreasEnsureSafety()

// Start a patrol session
const session = await patrol.initiatePatrol({
  rangerId: 'R-114',
  routeId: 'ROUTE-NORTH-RIDGE',
  startTime: '2026-02-05T06:00:00Z',
  mode: 'foot'
})

// Log a field observation
await patrol.logObservation({
  patrolId: session.id,
  type: 'wildlife-sighting',
  location: { lat: 37.7459, lng: -119.5332 },
  description: 'Black bear with two cubs near Merced River crossing'
})

// Issue a violation citation
await patrol.issueViolation({
  patrolId: session.id,
  type: 'illegal-campfire',
  location: { lat: 37.7481, lng: -119.5298 },
  individualId: 'VIS-9923',
  details: 'Campfire outside designated ring during fire restriction period'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert dispatch when emergency response occurs
patrol.emergencyResponded(async ({ patrolId, location, emergencyType }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'district-supervisor',
    message: `Emergency response initiated: ${emergencyType} at ${location.lat}, ${location.lng}`
  })
})

// Auto-close trail when hazard severity is critical
patrol.hazardReported(async ({ hazardId, severity, trailSegment }) => {
  if (severity === 'critical') {
    await closeTrailSegment({
      segment: trailSegment,
      reason: `Hazard report ${hazardId}: critical condition`
    })
  }
})
```
