## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { monitorFoodServicesOperationsEnsure } from '@headlessly/monitor-food-services-operations-ensure'

const foodServiceMonitoring = monitorFoodServicesOperationsEnsure()

// Conduct morning food safety check
const safetyCheck = await foodServiceMonitoring.conductSafetyCheck({
  locationId: 'kitchen-main',
  checklistId: 'daily-safety-inspection',
  items: [
    { item: 'hand-washing-stations', status: 'compliant' },
    { item: 'food-storage-temps', status: 'compliant' },
    { item: 'equipment-sanitation', status: 'non-compliant' },
    { item: 'pest-control', status: 'compliant' }
  ],
  inspectorId: 'monitor-123',
  timestamp: '2026-02-05T06:00:00Z'
})

// Record cooking temperature
await foodServiceMonitoring.recordTemperature({
  locationId: 'kitchen-main',
  foodItem: 'grilled-chicken-breast',
  temperatureType: 'internal-cooking',
  reading: 165, // Fahrenheit
  requiredMinimum: 165,
  timestamp: '2026-02-05T11:30:00Z',
  staffId: 'cook-456'
})

// Investigate customer complaint
await foodServiceMonitoring.investigateComplaint({
  locationId: 'dining-room-west',
  complaintType: 'food-quality',
  description: 'Chicken undercooked in center',
  severity: 'high',
  customerId: 'guest-789',
  timestamp: '2026-02-05T12:15:00Z'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-document violations and schedule training
foodServiceMonitoring.safetyCheckConducted(async ({ items, locationId }) => {
  const violations = items.filter(item => item.status === 'non-compliant')
  if (violations.length > 0) {
    const violation = await foodServiceMonitoring.documentViolation({
      locationId,
      violations: violations.map(v => v.item),
      severity: 'medium'
    })
    await foodServiceMonitoring.scheduleTraining({
      locationId,
      trainingType: 'corrective-action',
      topics: violations.map(v => v.item)
    })
  }
})

// Alert on dangerous temperature readings
foodServiceMonitoring.temperatureRecorded(async ({ foodItem, reading, requiredMinimum }) => {
  if (reading < requiredMinimum) {
    await notify({
      to: 'kitchen-manager',
      priority: 'urgent',
      message: `Temperature violation: ${foodItem} at ${reading}F (required ${requiredMinimum}F)`
    })
  }
})
```
