# Monitor Industrial Energy Consumption Management

> Business-as-Code definition for industrial energy consumption and management monitoring. Models the complete monitoring lifecycle from real-time usage tracking through efficiency analysis, demand response, and optimization initiatives.

## Overview

Industrial energy monitoring involves continuous oversight of electricity, natural gas, steam, and compressed air consumption across manufacturing processes, facilities, and equipment to identify inefficiencies, reduce costs, and support sustainability goals. This definition exposes actions for tracking energy usage, analyzing consumption patterns, implementing conservation measures, and coordinating with utilities.

## Actors

| Actor | Description |

| UtilityProvider | Supplies electricity, gas, or steam to facility |
| EnergyAuditor | Evaluates consumption patterns and efficiency opportunities |
| EquipmentOperator | Manages industrial machinery and systems |
| SustainabilityOfficer | Tracks environmental impact and reduction targets |
| FacilityEngineer | Maintains energy-consuming systems and infrastructure |

## Roles

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { monitorIndustrialEnergyConsumptionManagement } from '@headlessly/monitor-industrial-energy-consumption-management'

const energyMonitoring = monitorIndustrialEnergyConsumptionManagement()

// Track hourly electricity consumption
const consumption = await energyMonitoring.trackConsumption({
  facilityId: 'plant-north-campus',
  meterId: 'main-electric-meter',
  energyType: 'electricity',
  usage: 1850, // kWh
  demand: 3200, // kW
  powerFactor: 0.92,
  timestamp: '2026-02-05T14:00:00Z'
})

// Analyze efficiency for production line
const analysis = await energyMonitoring.analyzeEfficiency({
  facilityId: 'plant-north-campus',
  equipmentId: 'assembly-line-3',
  period: { start: '2026-02-01', end: '2026-02-05' },
  metrics: {
    totalConsumption: 45000, // kWh
    productionVolume: 12000, // units
    energyPerUnit: 3.75 // kWh/unit
  }
})

// Respond to demand event
await energyMonitoring.respondToDemand({
  facilityId: 'plant-north-campus',
  eventType: 'peak-pricing',
  eventWindow: { start: '2026-02-05T15:00:00Z', end: '2026-02-05T18:00:00Z' },
  actions: [
    { action: 'reduce-hvac-setpoint', equipment: 'rooftop-units-all', savings: 250 },
    { action: 'defer-non-critical-loads', equipment: 'batch-process-6', savings: 400 }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-implement conservation for identified opportunities
energyMonitoring.efficiencyAnalyzed(async ({ opportunities, facilityId }) => {
  const highImpact = opportunities.filter(opp => opp.savingsPotential > 5000)
  for (const opportunity of highImpact) {
    await energyMonitoring.implementConservation({
      facilityId,
      projectType: opportunity.recommendedAction,
      equipmentId: opportunity.equipmentId,
      estimatedSavings: opportunity.savingsPotential
    })
  }
})

// Alert on excessive consumption
energyMonitoring.consumptionTracked(async ({ usage, baseline, facilityId }) => {
  const variance = (usage - baseline) / baseline
  if (variance > 0.15) {
    await notify({
      to: 'energy-management-team',
      priority: 'high',
      message: `Consumption at ${facilityId} exceeds baseline by ${(variance * 100).toFixed(1)}%`
    })
  }
})
```
