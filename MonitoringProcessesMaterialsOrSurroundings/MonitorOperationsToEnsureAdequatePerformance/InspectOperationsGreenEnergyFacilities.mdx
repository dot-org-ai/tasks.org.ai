# Inspect Operations Green Energy Facilities

> Business-as-Code definition for green energy facility operations inspection. Models the complete inspection lifecycle from planning through performance verification, compliance documentation, and optimization recommendations.

## Overview

Green energy facility inspection involves evaluating the operational performance, safety, and environmental compliance of renewable energy installations including solar farms, wind turbines, hydroelectric plants, and biomass facilities. This definition exposes actions for scheduling inspections, monitoring performance metrics, documenting findings, and coordinating maintenance.

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| inspectionScheduled | Facility evaluation planned |
| performanceAssessed | Energy production metrics analyzed |
| complianceVerified | Environmental and safety standards confirmed |
| issueIdentified | Equipment or operational problem documented |
| optimizationRecommended | Improvement suggestion provided |
| operationCertified | Facility approved for continued operation |
| maintenanceRequested | Repair or service scheduled |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| findInspections | List inspections by facility, date, or type |
| getPerformanceMetrics | Retrieve energy production data |
| getComplianceRecords | Search environmental and safety documentation |
| getIssues | Find maintenance problems by facility or severity |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { inspectOperationsGreenEnergyFacilities } from '@headlessly/inspect-operations-green-energy-facilities'

const greenEnergyInspection = inspectOperationsGreenEnergyFacilities()

// Schedule quarterly wind farm inspection
const inspection = await greenEnergyInspection.scheduleInspection({
  facilityId: 'wind-farm-north-ridge',
  facilityType: 'wind',
  scheduledDate: '2026-03-15',
  inspectorId: 'inspector-345',
  scope: ['performance', 'compliance', 'safety']
})

// Assess energy production performance
const performance = await greenEnergyInspection.assessPerformance({
  inspectionId: inspection.id,
  period: { start: '2026-01-01', end: '2026-03-01' },
  metrics: {
    energyProduced: 125000, // MWh
    capacity: 150000, // MWh
    uptime: 0.92,
    turbinesOperational: 47,
    turbinesTotal: 50
  }
})

// Identify maintenance issue
await greenEnergyInspection.identifyIssue({
  inspectionId: inspection.id,
  turbineId: 'turbine-23',
  issueType: 'gearbox-vibration',
  severity: 'medium',
  description: 'Excessive vibration detected in main gearbox'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-schedule maintenance for critical issues
greenEnergyInspection.issueIdentified(async ({ issue, facilityId }) => {
  if (issue.severity === 'critical') {
    await greenEnergyInspection.requestMaintenance({
      facilityId,
      issueId: issue.id,
      priority: 'urgent',
      scheduledDate: 'next-available'
    })
  }
})

// Notify utility of performance shortfalls
greenEnergyInspection.performanceAssessed(async ({ performance, facilityId }) => {
  const efficiency = performance.energyProduced / performance.capacity
  if (efficiency < 0.75) {
    await notify({
      to: 'utility-operations',
      subject: 'Underperformance Alert',
      message: `Facility ${facilityId} operating at ${(efficiency * 100).toFixed(1)}% capacity`
    })
  }
})
```
