## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { trackGoodsMaterials } from '@headlessly/track-goods-materials'

const tracking = trackGoodsMaterials()

// Record receipt of materials
await tracking.recordReceipt({
  poNumber: 'PO-2026-001',
  supplier: 'Acme Materials Inc',
  items: [
    { sku: 'MTL-4501', quantity: 500, unit: 'kg' },
    { sku: 'MTL-4502', quantity: 250, unit: 'kg' }
  ],
  receivedAt: 'WAREHOUSE-A',
  receivedBy: 'receiving-clerk-03'
})

// Track material movement
await tracking.trackMovement({
  itemId: 'MTL-4501-BATCH-001',
  fromLocation: 'WAREHOUSE-A',
  toLocation: 'PRODUCTION-FLOOR-2',
  quantity: 50,
  unit: 'kg',
  movedBy: 'forklift-operator-12',
  reason: 'production-order-5423'
})

// Check current inventory
const stock = await tracking.checkInventory({
  location: 'WAREHOUSE-A',
  materials: ['MTL-4501', 'MTL-4502'],
  includeReserved: true
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on low stock levels
tracking.inventoryChecked(async ({ location, stockLevels }) => {
  for (const stock of stockLevels) {
    if (stock.quantity < stock.reorderPoint) {
      await notify({
        to: 'materials-planner',
        message: `Low stock alert: ${stock.sku} at ${location} - ${stock.quantity} ${stock.unit} remaining`,
        action: 'create-purchase-requisition'
      })
    }
  }
})

// Auto-update production on material receipt
tracking.receiptRecorded(async ({ items, receivedAt }) => {
  for (const item of items) {
    const pendingOrders = await findPendingProductionOrders({ materialSku: item.sku })

    if (pendingOrders.length > 0) {
      await notify({
        to: 'production-planner',
        message: `Material ${item.sku} now available at ${receivedAt} for ${pendingOrders.length} pending orders`
      })
    }
  }
})
```
