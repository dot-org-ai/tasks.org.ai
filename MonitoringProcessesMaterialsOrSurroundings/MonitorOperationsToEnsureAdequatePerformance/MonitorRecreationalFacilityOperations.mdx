## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { monitorRecreationalFacilityOperations } from '@headlessly/monitor-recreational-facility-operations'

const facility = monitorRecreationalFacilityOperations()

// Monitor facility usage
await facility.monitorUsage({
  facilityId: 'POOL-MAIN',
  amenity: 'Olympic Swimming Pool',
  currentOccupancy: 45,
  maxCapacity: 100,
  timestamp: new Date()
})

// Log a safety incident
const incident = await facility.logIncident({
  facilityId: 'POOL-MAIN',
  type: 'minor-injury',
  description: 'Guest slipped on pool deck',
  location: 'Main Pool Deck, North Side',
  severity: 'low',
  actionTaken: 'First aid provided, incident report filed'
})

// Request maintenance
await facility.requestMaintenance({
  facilityId: 'POOL-MAIN',
  area: 'Pool Deck',
  issue: 'Cracked tile creating slip hazard',
  priority: 'high',
  requestedBy: 'safety-coordinator'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on capacity limits
facility.usageMonitored(async ({ facilityId, currentOccupancy, maxCapacity }) => {
  const utilizationRate = currentOccupancy / maxCapacity

  if (utilizationRate > 0.90) {
    await notify({
      to: 'facility-staff',
      message: `${facilityId} approaching capacity: ${currentOccupancy}/${maxCapacity}`,
      action: 'prepare-guest-queue-management'
    })
  }
})

// Auto-inspect after incident
facility.incidentLogged(async ({ facilityId, type, location }) => {
  if (type === 'injury' || type === 'equipment-failure') {
    await facility.inspectSafety({
      facilityId,
      focus: location,
      priority: 'immediate'
    })
  }
})
```
