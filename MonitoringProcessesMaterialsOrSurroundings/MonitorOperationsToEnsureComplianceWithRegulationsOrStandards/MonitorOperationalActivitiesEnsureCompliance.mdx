# Monitor Operational Activities Ensure Compliance

> Business-as-Code definition for monitoring operational activities against regulations and standard operating procedures. Tracks compliance status across business units and triggers corrective actions when deviations are detected.

## Overview

Operational compliance monitoring involves systematically observing, measuring, and evaluating day-to-day business activities to ensure they conform to applicable regulations, internal policies, and standard operating procedures. This definition provides actions for scheduling and conducting compliance checks, events for automated escalation workflows, and searches for retrieving compliance status across the organization.

| resolveDeviation | Mark a deviation as resolved after corrective action is verified |
| generateReport | Produce a compliance report for a given period or business unit |
| escalateViolation | Elevate a serious or recurring violation to senior leadership |

## Events

| Event | Description |

| checkScheduled | A compliance check has been planned and assigned |
| checkCompleted | A compliance evaluation has finished with findings recorded |
| deviationRecorded | A non-compliance instance has been identified and logged |
| correctiveActionAssigned | A remediation task has been created for a deviation |
| deviationResolved | A deviation has been verified as corrected |
| violationEscalated | A critical violation has been raised to senior leadership |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { monitorOperationalActivitiesEnsureCompliance } from '@headlessly/monitor-operational-activities-ensure-compliance'

const compliance = monitorOperationalActivitiesEnsureCompliance()

// Schedule a quarterly compliance check
const check = await compliance.scheduleCheck({
  operation: 'warehouse-fulfillment',
  regulations: ['OSHA-1910', 'EPA-RCRA'],
  scheduledDate: '2026-04-01',
  assignedTo: 'internal-audit-team'
})

// Record a deviation found during the check
await compliance.recordDeviation({
  checkId: check.id,
  regulation: 'OSHA-1910.178',
  description: 'Forklift operators missing current certification',
  severity: 'high'
})

// Assign corrective action
await compliance.assignCorrectiveAction({
  deviationId: 'DEV-2026-0042',
  assignee: 'operations-manager',
  action: 'Schedule recertification training for all forklift operators',
  dueDate: '2026-04-15'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Escalate critical deviations automatically
compliance.deviationRecorded(async ({ deviationId, severity, regulation }) => {
  if (severity === 'critical') {
    await compliance.escalateViolation({
      deviationId,
      notifyRoles: ['ComplianceOfficer', 'ExecutiveLeadership'],
      regulation
    })
  }
})

// Auto-generate report when all deviations in a check are resolved
compliance.deviationResolved(async ({ checkId }) => {
  const openDeviations = await compliance.getDeviations({ checkId, status: 'open' })
  if (openDeviations.length === 0) {
    await compliance.generateReport({ checkId })
  }
})
```
