## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { evaluatePersonnelPracticesEnsureAdherence } from '@headlessly/evaluate-personnel-practices-ensure-adherence'

const personnel = evaluatePersonnelPracticesEnsureAdherence()

// Conduct an annual HR practices audit
const audit = await personnel.auditHRPractices({
  scope: ['hiring', 'compensation', 'classification', 'leave-management'],
  regulations: ['FLSA', 'Title-VII', 'ADA', 'FMLA'],
  departments: ['engineering', 'sales', 'operations'],
  period: '2026'
})

// Review hiring compliance specifically
await personnel.reviewHiringCompliance({
  auditId: audit.id,
  sampleSize: 100,
  evaluationCriteria: ['job-posting-language', 'interview-documentation', 'background-check-process']
})

// Identify a practice gap
await personnel.identifyPracticeGap({
  auditId: audit.id,
  regulation: 'FLSA-overtime',
  description: 'Misclassification of 12 employees as exempt who do not meet duties test',
  severity: 'high',
  affectedEmployees: 12
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Escalate high-severity practice gaps to legal counsel
personnel.practiceGapIdentified(async ({ regulation, severity, description }) => {
  if (severity === 'high') {
    await notify({
      to: ['hr-director', 'legal-counsel'],
      message: `High-severity HR compliance gap: ${regulation} - ${description}`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-schedule re-audit after policy updates
personnel.policyUpdated(async ({ policyId, affectedRegulations }) => {
  await personnel.auditHRPractices({
    scope: affectedRegulations,
    reason: `Post-policy-update verification for ${policyId}`,
    scheduledDate: '30-days-from-now'
  })
})
```
