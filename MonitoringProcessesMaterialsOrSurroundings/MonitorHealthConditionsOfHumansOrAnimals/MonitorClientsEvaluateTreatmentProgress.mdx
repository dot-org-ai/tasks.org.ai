## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { monitorClientsEvaluateTreatmentProgress } from '@headlessly/monitor-clients-evaluate-treatment-progress'

const progress = monitorClientsEvaluateTreatmentProgress()

// Record therapy session
await progress.recordSession({
  clientId: 'client-789',
  therapistId: 'therapist-45',
  duration: 50,
  interventions: ['CBT', 'exposure-therapy'],
  notes: 'Client demonstrated improved coping skills'
})

// Assess progress on goals
const assessment = await progress.assessProgress({
  clientId: 'client-789',
  period: 'monthly'
})

// Measure outcome with standardized tool
await progress.measureOutcome({
  clientId: 'client-789',
  instrument: 'PHQ-9',
  score: 8,
  interpretation: 'mild-depression'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Update plan when barrier identified
progress.barrierIdentified(async ({ clientId, barrier }) => {
  await progress.updatePlan({
    clientId,
    modifications: [
      { type: 'add-intervention', value: getBarrierIntervention(barrier) }
    ]
  })
})

// Schedule review when goal achieved
progress.goalAchieved(async ({ clientId, goalId }) => {
  const remainingGoals = await progress.getProgress({ clientId })
  if (remainingGoals.length === 0) {
    await progress.scheduleReview({
      clientId,
      type: 'discharge-planning'
    })
  }
})
```
