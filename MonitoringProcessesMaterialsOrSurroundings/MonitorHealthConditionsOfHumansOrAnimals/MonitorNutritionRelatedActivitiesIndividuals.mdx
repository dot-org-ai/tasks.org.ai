## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { monitorNutritionRelatedActivitiesIndividuals } from '@headlessly/monitor-nutrition-related-activities-individuals'

const nutrition = monitorNutritionRelatedActivitiesIndividuals()

// Log breakfast meal
await nutrition.logMeal({
  participantId: 'participant-123',
  mealType: 'breakfast',
  items: [
    { food: 'oatmeal', portion: '1 cup', calories: 150 },
    { food: 'banana', portion: '1 medium', calories: 105 },
    { food: 'milk', portion: '8 oz', calories: 120 }
  ],
  timestamp: new Date()
})

// Assess weekly intake
const assessment = await nutrition.assessIntake({
  participantId: 'participant-123',
  period: 'week',
  targets: ['calories', 'protein', 'fiber']
})

// Track compliance with meal plan
const compliance = await nutrition.trackCompliance({
  participantId: 'participant-123',
  period: 'month'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Schedule counseling when deficiency identified
nutrition.deficiencyIdentified(async ({ participantId, nutrient, severity }) => {
  if (severity === 'high') {
    await scheduleIntervention({
      participantId,
      type: 'nutrition-counseling',
      priority: 'urgent',
      focus: nutrient
    })
  }
})

// Adjust plan when compliance low
nutrition.complianceTracked(async ({ participantId, rate }) => {
  if (rate < 0.7) {
    await nutrition.adjustPlan({
      participantId,
      adjustments: ['simplify-requirements', 'add-flexibility']
    })
  }
})
```
