## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { monitorMarketConditionsTrends } from '@headlessly/monitor-market-conditions-trends'

const market = monitorMarketConditionsTrends()

// Initiate tracking for product category
await market.initiateTracking({
  segments: ['consumer-electronics', 'industrial-components'],
  regions: ['north-america', 'asia-pacific'],
  indicators: ['pricing', 'demand', 'inventory-levels'],
  frequency: 'hourly'
})

// Collect data and analyze trends
const data = await market.collectMarketData({
  segments: ['consumer-electronics'],
  sources: ['trading-platforms', 'competitor-pricing', 'search-trends']
})

const trends = await market.analyzeTrends({
  marketData: data,
  timeWindow: '90-days',
  metrics: ['price-elasticity', 'demand-volatility']
})

const forecast = await market.forecastDemand({
  trends,
  forecastPeriod: '6-months',
  confidence: 0.85
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Recommend action on significant market shift
market.shiftDetected(async ({ segment, shiftType, magnitude }) => {
  if (magnitude > 0.15) {
    await market.recommendAction({
      segment,
      shiftType,
      considerationAreas: ['pricing', 'inventory', 'promotions']
    })
  }
})

// Alert pricing team on competitor moves
market.competitionAssessed(async ({ competitorId, action, impact }) => {
  if (impact === 'high') {
    await notify({
      to: 'pricing-team',
      message: `Competitor ${competitorId} action: ${action}`,
      urgency: 'high'
    })
