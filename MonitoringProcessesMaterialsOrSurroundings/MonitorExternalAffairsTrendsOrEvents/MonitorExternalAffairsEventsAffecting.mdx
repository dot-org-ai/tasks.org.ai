## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { monitorExternalAffairsEventsAffecting } from '@headlessly/monitor-external-affairs-events-affecting'

const monitor = monitorExternalAffairsEventsAffecting()

// Initiate monitoring for regulatory and geopolitical events
await monitor.initiateMonitoring({
  domains: ['regulatory', 'geopolitical', 'economic'],
  regions: ['north-america', 'european-union', 'asia-pacific'],
  sources: ['government-feeds', 'news-apis', 'analyst-reports']
})

// Scan sources and detect events
const scan = await monitor.scanSources({
  domains: ['regulatory'],
  keywords: ['data-privacy', 'cybersecurity', 'financial-reporting']
})

const events = await monitor.detectEvent({
  scanResults: scan,
  significanceThreshold: 0.75
})

const assessment = await monitor.assessImpact({
  eventId: events[0].id,
  operationalAreas: ['supply-chain', 'compliance', 'finance']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify stakeholders on high-urgency events
monitor.urgencyClassified(async ({ eventId, urgency, impactAreas }) => {
  if (urgency === 'high' || urgency === 'critical') {
    await monitor.notifyStakeholders({
      eventId,
      recipients: getStakeholders(impactAreas),
      channel: 'immediate-alert'
    })
  }
})

// Auto-develop response for regulatory changes
monitor.eventDetected(async ({ eventId, eventType }) => {
  if (eventType === 'regulatory-change') {
    await monitor.developResponse({
      eventId,
      includeComplianceReview: true,
      assignTo: 'legal-team'
    })
  }
})
```
