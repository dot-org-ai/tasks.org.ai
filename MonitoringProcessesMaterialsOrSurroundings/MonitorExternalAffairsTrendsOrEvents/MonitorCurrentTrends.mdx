## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { monitorCurrentTrends } from '@headlessly/monitor-current-trends'

const trends = monitorCurrentTrends()

// Start tracking consumer technology trends
await trends.startTracking({
  categories: ['artificial-intelligence', 'mobile-commerce', 'sustainability'],
  sources: ['social-media', 'search-trends', 'competitor-activity'],
  updateFrequency: 'daily'
})

// Collect and analyze trend data
const data = await trends.collectData({
  categories: ['artificial-intelligence'],
  timeframe: 'last-30-days'
})

const patterns = await trends.identifyPattern({
  data,
  minSignalStrength: 0.7
})

const impact = await trends.analyzeImpact({
  trends: patterns,
  businessContext: 'product-roadmap'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-generate reports on pattern identification
trends.patternIdentified(async ({ trendId, category, strength }) => {
  if (strength > 0.8) {
    await trends.generateReport({
      trendId,
      includeCompetitorAnalysis: true,
      distributeTo: ['strategy-team', 'product-team']
    })
  }
})

// Share insights when reports are complete
trends.reportGenerated(async ({ reportId, category }) => {
  await trends.shareInsights({
    reportId,
    channels: ['email', 'dashboard'],
    recipients: getStakeholders(category)
  })
})
```
