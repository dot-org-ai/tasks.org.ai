### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { monitorSalesActivities } from '@headlessly/monitor-sales-activities'

const sales = monitorSalesActivities()

// Track a sales call
await sales.trackActivity({
  repId: 'rep-456',
  type: 'phone-call',
  dealId: 'deal-789',
  duration: 30,
  notes: 'Discussed pricing and implementation timeline'
})

// Update deal stage
await sales.updateDealStage({
  dealId: 'deal-789',
  stage: 'negotiation',
  probability: 75
})

// Assess quarterly performance
const performance = await sales.assessPerformance({
  repId: 'rep-456',

// Alert manager when quota is missed
sales.quotaMissed(async ({ repId, period, quota, actual }) => {
  await sales.scheduleReview({
    repId,
    managerId: await getManager(repId),
    reason: 'quota-miss',
    urgency: 'high'
  })
})

// Auto-forecast on stage change
sales.dealStageUpdated(async ({ dealId }) => {
  const pipeline = await sales.getPipeline({ repId: deal.repId })
  await sales.generateForecast({ pipeline })
})
```
