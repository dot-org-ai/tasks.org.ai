## Overview

Financial indicators monitoring involves systematic measurement and analysis of financial ratios, metrics, and benchmarks that reflect organizational performance, solvency, and operational efficiency. This definition provides actions for indicator calculation and trend analysis, events for automated alerting on threshold breaches, and searches for retrieving financial metrics and comparative data.

| CreditAgency | Evaluates creditworthiness based on financial indicators |
| IndustryBenchmark | Supplies comparative financial performance standards |
| BoardOfDirectors | Reviews financial indicators for governance oversight |
| ExternalAuditor | Validates accuracy of financial indicator calculations |

## Roles

## Entities

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| FinancialIndicator | Calculated metric reflecting financial performance or position |
| Ratio | Comparative measure of financial statement line items |
| Threshold | Boundary value indicating acceptable indicator range |
| Trend | Pattern in indicator values over time |
| Alert | Notification of indicator threshold breach or anomaly |
| BenchmarkComparison | Assessment of indicators relative to industry standards |

| indicatorsDefined | Financial metrics have been established |
| ratiosCalculated | Financial indicators have been computed |
| trendsAnalyzed | Pattern analysis of indicators is complete |
| healthAssessed | Overall financial condition evaluation is complete |
| benchmarksCompared | Industry comparative analysis is complete |
| degradationDetected | Declining financial performance has been identified |
| indicatorsReported | Financial metrics have been communicated |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { monitorFinancialIndicators } from '@headlessly/monitor-financial-indicators'

const indicators = monitorFinancialIndicators()

// Define key financial indicators
await indicators.defineIndicators({
  categories: ['profitability', 'liquidity', 'efficiency', 'leverage'],
  metrics: [
    { name: 'gross-profit-margin', category: 'profitability', threshold: 0.35 },
    { name: 'current-ratio', category: 'liquidity', threshold: 1.5 },
    { name: 'asset-turnover', category: 'efficiency', threshold: 1.2 },
    { name: 'debt-to-equity', category: 'leverage', threshold: 1.0 }
  ]
})

// Calculate ratios and analyze trends
const ratios = await indicators.calculateRatios({
  period: 'Q4-2025',
  source: 'financial-statements'
})

const trends = await indicators.analyzeTrends({
  indicators: ratios,
  lookbackPeriods: 8,
  trendTypes: ['linear', 'moving-average']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on financial degradation
indicators.degradationDetected(async ({ indicatorName, currentValue, threshold, trend }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'finance-leadership',
    message: `${indicatorName} degradation: ${currentValue} vs threshold ${threshold}`,
    urgency: 'high',
    includeTrendChart: true
  })
})

// Auto-report indicators quarterly
indicators.ratiosCalculated(async ({ period }) => {
  if (isQuarterEnd(period)) {
    await indicators.reportIndicators({
      period,
      recipients: ['board-of-directors', 'investor-relations'],
      format: 'executive-summary'
    })
  }
})
```
