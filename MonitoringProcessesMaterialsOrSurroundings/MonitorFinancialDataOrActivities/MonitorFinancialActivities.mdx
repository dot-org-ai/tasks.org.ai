## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { monitorFinancialActivities } from '@headlessly/monitor-financial-activities'

const monitor = monitorFinancialActivities()

// Start monitoring primary operating accounts
await monitor.startMonitoring({
  accounts: ['operating-checking', 'payroll-account', 'merchant-account'],
  captureInterval: 300000, // ms
  reconciliationFrequency: 'daily'
})

// Capture and reconcile transactions
const transactions = await monitor.captureTransactions({
  accounts: ['operating-checking'],
  timeframe: 'today'
})

const reconciliation = await monitor.reconcileAccounts({
  account: 'operating-checking',
  transactions,
  statementDate: '2026-02-05'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Escalate significant anomalies immediately
monitor.anomalyDetected(async ({ transactionId, anomalyType, severity }) => {
  if (severity === 'high' || severity === 'critical') {
    await monitor.escalateIssue({
      transactionId,
      notifyRoles: ['controller', 'cfo'],
      urgency: 'immediate'
    })
  }
})

// Auto-generate daily financial activity reports
monitor.accountsReconciled(async ({ account, date }) => {
  if (isBusinessDayEnd(date)) {
    await monitor.generateReport({
      accounts: [account],
      period: 'daily',
      distributeTo: ['treasury-team', 'accounting']
    })
  }
})
```
