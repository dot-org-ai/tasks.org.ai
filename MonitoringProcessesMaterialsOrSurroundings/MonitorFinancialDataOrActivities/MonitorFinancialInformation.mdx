## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { monitorFinancialInformation } from '@headlessly/monitor-financial-information'

const monitor = monitorFinancialInformation()

// Activate tracking for financial information sources
await monitor.activateTracking({
  sources: ['general-ledger', 'accounts-payable', 'accounts-receivable', 'payroll'],
  validationFrequency: 'daily',
  auditLogging: 'all-changes'
})

// Collect and validate financial data
const data = await monitor.collectData({
  sources: ['general-ledger'],
  period: '2026-01',
  accounts: 'all'
})

const validation = await monitor.validateAccuracy({
  data,
  rules: ['balance-check', 'period-consistency', 'account-mapping']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Investigate discrepancies immediately
monitor.discrepancyDetected(async ({ sourceId, discrepancyType, amount }) => {
  if (Math.abs(amount) > 10000) {
    await notify({
      to: 'accounting-manager',
      message: `Financial discrepancy: ${discrepancyType} of ${amount}`,
      urgency: 'high'
    })
  }
})

// Auto-distribute reports on schedule
monitor.sourcesReconciled(async ({ period }) => {
  if (isMonthEnd(period)) {
    await monitor.distributeReports({
      period,
      reports: ['balance-sheet', 'income-statement', 'cash-flow'],
      recipients: ['executive-team', 'board-of-directors']
    })
  }
})
```
