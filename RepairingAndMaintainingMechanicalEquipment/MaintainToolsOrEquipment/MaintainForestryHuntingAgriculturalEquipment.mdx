## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainForestryHuntingAgriculturalEquipment } from '@headlessly/maintain-forestry-hunting-agricultural-equipment'

const equipment = maintainForestryHuntingAgriculturalEquipment()

// Schedule pre-season maintenance for planting
const schedule = await equipment.scheduleSeasonalService({
  season: 'spring-planting',
  equipmentIds: ['TRACTOR-204', 'HARVESTER-107', 'SPRAYER-015'],
  targetCompletion: '2026-03-15'
})

// Perform field maintenance on a tractor
await equipment.performFieldMaintenance({
  equipmentId: 'TRACTOR-204',
  tasks: ['oil-change', 'air-filter-replacement', 'hydraulic-fluid-check'],
  location: 'North Field Depot'
})

// Record completed service
await equipment.recordServiceCompletion({
  equipmentId: 'TRACTOR-204',
  completedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  hoursAtService: 1250
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-order parts when inspection reveals deficiencies
equipment.equipmentInspected(async ({ equipmentId, findings }) => {
  const partsNeeded = findings.filter(f => f.requiresReplacement)
  if (partsNeeded.length > 0) {
    await equipment.orderReplacementParts({
      equipmentId,
      parts: partsNeeded.map(p => p.partNumber)
    })
  }
})

// Alert when compliance certificates expire
equipment.complianceCertified(async ({ equipmentId, expiresAt }) => {
  await scheduleReminder({
    date: subtractDays(expiresAt, 30),
    message: `Compliance renewal due for ${equipmentId}`
  })
})
```
