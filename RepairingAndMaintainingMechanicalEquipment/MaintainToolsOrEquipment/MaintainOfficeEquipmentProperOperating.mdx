## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainOfficeEquipmentProperOperating } from '@headlessly/maintain-office-equipment-proper-operating'

const office = maintainOfficeEquipmentProperOperating()

// Schedule preventive maintenance for copier fleet
const service = await office.schedulePreventiveMaintenance({
  deviceId: 'copier-3rd-floor-01',
  serviceType: 'quarterly-cleaning',
  scheduledDate: '2026-04-01',
  provider: 'acme-office-services'
})

// Replace toner on a printer
await office.replaceConsumable({
  deviceId: 'printer-hr-02',
  consumableType: 'toner-cartridge',
  partNumber: 'TN-436BK',
  replacedBy: 'facilities-garcia'
})

// Track usage metrics across the fleet
const metrics = await office.trackUsageMetrics({
  deviceId: 'copier-3rd-floor-01',
  period: '2026-Q1',
  pageCount: 24500,
  colorPages: 3200
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-order toner when stock runs low
office.consumableReplaced(async ({ deviceId, consumableType }) => {
  const levels = await office.getConsumableLevels({ consumableType })
  if (levels.onHand < levels.reorderPoint) {
    await notify({
      to: 'procurement-officer',
      message: `${consumableType} stock below reorder point. Current: ${levels.onHand}, Reorder at: ${levels.reorderPoint}`
    })
  }
})

// Notify administrator when service contract nears expiration
office.serviceContractRenewed(async ({ contractId, expirationDate }) => {
  await scheduleReminder({
    date: subtractDays(expirationDate, 60),
    to: 'office-administrator',
    message: `Service contract ${contractId} expires on ${expirationDate}. Begin renewal process.`
  })
})
```
