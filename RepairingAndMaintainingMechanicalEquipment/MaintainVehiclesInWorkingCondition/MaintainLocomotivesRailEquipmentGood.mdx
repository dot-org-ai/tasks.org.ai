# Maintain Locomotives Rail Equipment Good

> Business-as-Code definition for maintaining locomotives and rail equipment in good working condition to ensure safe, reliable rail operations and compliance with federal railroad safety standards.

## Overview

Maintaining locomotives and rail equipment involves servicing diesel-electric and electric locomotives, freight cars, passenger coaches, and specialized rail vehicles such as maintenance-of-way equipment. This includes engine overhauls, traction motor maintenance, air brake system testing, coupler inspections, and compliance with FRA (Federal Railroad Administration) safety regulations. This definition exposes actions for managing maintenance programs across rail yards and shops, tracking equipment condition by mileage and operating hours, and coordinating with regulatory agencies on inspection and certification requirements.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainLocomotivesRailEquipmentGood } from '@headlessly/maintain-locomotives-rail-equipment-good'

const rail = maintainLocomotivesRailEquipmentGood()

// Schedule shop time for a locomotive
const shopSlot = await rail.scheduleShopTime({
  equipmentId: 'LOCO-SD70ACE-4127',
  shopId: 'SHOP-EAST-YARD',
  scope: ['annual-inspection', 'traction-motor-service', 'air-brake-certification'],
  scheduledDate: '2026-03-01'
})

// Conduct FRA-mandated inspection
const inspection = await rail.conductFRAInspection({
  equipmentId: 'LOCO-SD70ACE-4127',
  inspectionType: 'annual',
  inspector: 'foreman-kowalski'
})

// Test the air brake system
const brakeTest = await rail.testAirBrakeSystem({
  equipmentId: 'LOCO-SD70ACE-4127',
  testType: 'class-1A-brake-test',
  pressure: { mainReservoir: 140, brakePipe: 90 }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Flag equipment when FRA inspections are overdue
rail.fraInspectionConducted(async ({ equipmentId, nextDueDate }) => {
  await scheduleReminder({
    date: subtractDays(nextDueDate, 30),
    to: 'inspection-foreman',
    message: `FRA inspection due in 30 days for ${equipmentId}`
  })
})

// Auto-notify railroad operator when equipment is certified for service
rail.equipmentCertified(async ({ equipmentId, certificationDate }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'railroad-dispatch',
    message: `${equipmentId} certified and available for revenue service as of ${certificationDate}`
  })
})
```
