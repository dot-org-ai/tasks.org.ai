# Maintain Vehicles Good Working Condition

> Business-as-Code definition for maintaining vehicles in good working condition through systematic inspection, preventive maintenance, and corrective repair programs.

## Overview

Maintaining vehicles in good working condition involves implementing and managing comprehensive maintenance programs that combine scheduled preventive maintenance, condition-based monitoring, and timely corrective repairs across individual vehicles or entire fleets. This definition exposes actions for establishing maintenance standards, tracking vehicle condition metrics, managing repair workflows, and ensuring compliance with safety and emissions regulations.

| initiateCorrectiveRepair | Create a work order to address a deficiency found during inspection or operation |
| trackVehicleCondition | Record and monitor key metrics such as mileage, fluid levels, and wear indicators |
| verifyComplianceStatus | Confirm vehicles meet current safety, emissions, and registration requirements |
| updateMaintenanceProgram | Adjust service intervals or standards based on performance data and manufacturer updates |
| closeRepairWorkOrder | Document completion of corrective work and return the vehicle to service |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| scheduledInspectionConducted | A vehicle has completed its periodic inspection |
| preventiveMaintenanceExecuted | Scheduled maintenance tasks have been performed |
| correctiveRepairInitiated | A work order has been created for a discovered deficiency |
| vehicleConditionTracked | Updated condition metrics have been recorded for a vehicle |
| complianceStatusVerified | A vehicle has been confirmed compliant with regulatory requirements |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainVehiclesGoodWorkingCondition } from '@headlessly/maintain-vehicles-good-working-condition'

const fleet = maintainVehiclesGoodWorkingCondition()

// Conduct scheduled inspection on a delivery van
const inspection = await fleet.conductScheduledInspection({
  vehicleId: 'VAN-FLEET-093',
  checklist: 'standard-commercial-vehicle',
  inspector: 'tech-rodriguez',
  currentMileage: 67432
})

// Initiate repair for a discovered brake issue
const repairOrder = await fleet.initiateCorrectiveRepair({
  vehicleId: 'VAN-FLEET-093',
  deficiency: 'Rear brake pads below minimum thickness',
  priority: 'high',
  source: inspection.id
})

// Verify compliance after repairs
await fleet.verifyComplianceStatus({
  vehicleId: 'VAN-FLEET-093',
  checks: ['safety-inspection', 'emissions-test', 'recall-status']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-create repair orders for critical deficiencies
fleet.scheduledInspectionConducted(async ({ vehicleId, findings }) => {
  const critical = findings.filter(f => f.severity === 'critical')
  for (const deficiency of critical) {
    await fleet.initiateCorrectiveRepair({
      vehicleId,
      deficiency: deficiency.description,
      priority: 'urgent'
    })
  }
})

// Notify dispatch when vehicles return to service
fleet.repairWorkOrderClosed(async ({ vehicleId, workOrderId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'dispatch-coordinator',
    message: `${vehicleId} repair complete (WO: ${workOrderId}), vehicle available for assignment`
  })
})
```
