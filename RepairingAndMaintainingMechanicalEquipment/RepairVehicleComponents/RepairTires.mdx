## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { repairTires } from '@headlessly/repair-tires'

const tires = repairTires()

// Inspect a tire reported as losing pressure
const inspection = await tires.inspectTire({
  vehicleId: 'VH-2024-1122',
  position: 'front-left',
  reportedIssue: 'Slow air leak'
})

// Assess whether the damage is repairable
const assessment = await tires.assessDamage({
  tireId: inspection.tireId,
  damageType: 'puncture',
  location: 'tread-center',
  diameter: 4 // mm
})

// Repair the puncture if eligible
if (assessment.repairable) {
  await tires.repairPuncture({ tireId: inspection.tireId, method: 'patch-plug' })
  await tires.balanceTire({ tireId: inspection.tireId })
  await tires.verifyRepair({ tireId: inspection.tireId })
}
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert fleet manager when a tire cannot be repaired
tires.damageAssessed(async ({ tireId, repairable, vehicleId }) => {
  if (!repairable) {
    await notify({
      to: 'fleet-manager',
      message: `Tire ${tireId} on vehicle ${vehicleId} requires replacement.`
    })
  }
})

// Reorder stock when inventory drops below threshold
tires.tireReplaced(async ({ tireSize, tireBrand }) => {
  const stock = await tires.findTireInventory({ size: tireSize, brand: tireBrand })
  if (stock.count < 4) {
    await createPurchaseOrder({ item: `${tireBrand} ${tireSize}`, quantity: 10 })
  }
})
```
