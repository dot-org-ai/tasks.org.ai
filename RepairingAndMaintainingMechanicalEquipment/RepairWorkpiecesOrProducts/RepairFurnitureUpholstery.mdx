## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { repairFurnitureUpholstery } from '@headlessly/repair-furniture-upholstery'

const furniture = repairFurnitureUpholstery()

// Assess damage on a submitted piece
const assessment = await furniture.assessFurnitureDamage({
  itemId: 'item-3290',
  description: 'Victorian armchair',
  defects: ['broken leg joint', 'worn seat fabric', 'loose spring']
})

// Generate estimate for the client
const estimate = await furniture.generateEstimate({
  itemId: assessment.itemId,
  repairTypes: ['structural', 'reupholstery'],
  fabricOption: { type: 'velvet', color: 'navy', yardage: 4.5 }
})

// Verify quality after all work is complete
const completion = await furniture.verifyCompletion({
  orderId: 'order-7712',
  checkpoints: ['joint-strength', 'fabric-tension', 'finish-quality']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify client when repair is finished
furniture.repairCompleted(async ({ itemId, orderId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'furniture-owner',
    message: `Your furniture repair (order ${orderId}) is complete and ready for pickup.`
  })
})

// Trigger reupholstery after structural repair is done
furniture.structureRepaired(async ({ itemId, orderId, requiresUpholstery }) => {
  if (requiresUpholstery) {
    await furniture.reupholster({
      itemId,
      orderId,
      fabricSelectionId: 'fabric-sel-001'
    })
  }
})
```
