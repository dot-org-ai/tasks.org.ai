# Administer Blood Fluids Intravenously

> Business-as-Code definition for intravenous administration of blood products and fluids. Manages IV access, fluid selection, infusion rate, and patient monitoring for safe transfusion and hydration therapy.

## Overview

Intravenous fluid and blood administration involves establishing vascular access, verifying patient and product compatibility, setting infusion parameters, and monitoring for adverse reactions. This definition provides actions for IV line placement, product verification, infusion management, and complication monitoring, with events to trigger safety protocols and documentation requirements.

## Actors

| Actor | Description |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { administerBloodFluidsIntravenously } from '@headlessly/administer-blood-fluids-intravenously'

const infusion = administerBloodFluidsIntravenously()

// Verify IV therapy order
const order = await infusion.verifyOrder({
  patientId: 'patient-78901',
  orderId: 'iv-order-2026-001',
  fluidType: 'lactated-ringers',
  volume: 1000,
  rate: '125-ml-per-hour',
  duration: '8-hours'
})

// Establish IV access
const access = await infusion.establishAccess({
  patientId: 'patient-78901',
  accessType: 'peripheral-iv',
  location: 'left-forearm',
  catheterSize: '18-gauge',
  establishedBy: 'infusion-nurse-456'
})

// Prepare and initiate infusion
const prepared = await infusion.prepareInfusion({
  orderId: order.id,
  accessLineId: access.id,
  pumpType: 'programmable-infusion-pump',
  tubing: 'standard-iv-set'
})

await infusion.initiateInfusion({
  orderId: order.id,
  accessLineId: access.id,
  startTime: new Date().toISOString(),
  initiatedBy: 'infusion-nurse-456'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Check compatibility immediately for blood products
infusion.orderVerified(async ({ orderId, fluidType, patientId }) => {
  if (fluidType.startsWith('blood-')) {
    await infusion.checkCompatibility({
      patientId,
      orderId,
      bloodProduct: fluidType,
      verificationMethod: 'bedside-crossmatch'
    })
  }
})

// Monitor patient continuously after infusion initiated
infusion.infusionInitiated(async ({ patientId, orderId }) => {
  await infusion.monitorPatient({
    patientId,
    orderId,
    parameters: ['vital-signs', 'infusion-site', 'patient-comfort'],
    frequency: 'every-15-minutes',
    alertOn: ['fever', 'rash', 'difficulty-breathing', 'chest-pain']
  })
})
```
