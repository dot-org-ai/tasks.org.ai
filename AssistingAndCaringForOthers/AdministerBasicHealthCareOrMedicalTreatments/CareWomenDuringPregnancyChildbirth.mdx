import { careWomenDuringPregnancyChildbirth } from '@headlessly/care-women-during-pregnancy-childbirth'

const maternity = careWomenDuringPregnancyChildbirth()

// Conduct first trimester assessment
const assessment = await maternity.assessPrenatal({
  patientId: 'PT-456123',
  gestationalAge: 12,
  vitalSigns: { bp: '118/76', pulse: 72, weight: 145 },
  fetalHeartRate: 152
})

// Schedule regular prenatal visits
await maternity.schedulePrenatalVisit({
  patientId: 'PT-456123',
  visitType: 'routine-second-trimester',
  preferredDate: '2026-05-15',
  includeUltrasound: true
})

// Monitor active labor
await maternity.monitorLabor({
  patientId: 'PT-456123',
  cervicalDilation: 6,
  contractionInterval: 3,
  fetalPosition: 'vertex',
  painLevel: 7
})

// Assess newborn immediately after delivery
await maternity.assessNewborn({

// Alert on concerning vital signs
maternity.prenatalAssessed(async ({ patientId, vitalSigns }) => {
  if (vitalSigns.bp.systolic > 140 || vitalSigns.bp.diastolic > 90) {
    await notify({
      to: 'obstetrician-on-call',
      message: `Elevated BP in patient ${patientId}`,
      priority: 'high'
    })
