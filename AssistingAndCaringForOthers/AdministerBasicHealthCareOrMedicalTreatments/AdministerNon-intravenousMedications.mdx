### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { administerNonIntravenousMedications } from '@headlessly/administer-non-intravenous-medications'

const medications = administerNonIntravenousMedications()

// Verify prescription before administration
const prescription = await medications.verifyPrescription({
  patientId: 'P12345',
  orderId: 'RX456',
  medication: 'Metformin 500mg',
  route: 'oral',
  dose: '500mg',
  frequency: 'BID',
  time: '0800'
})

// Prepare the dose
const dose = await medications.prepareDose({
  patientId: 'P12345',
  medication: 'Metformin 500mg',
  quantity: 1,
  unit: 'tablet'
})

// Educate patient
await medications.educatePatient({
  patientId: 'P12345',
  medication: 'Metformin',
  purpose: 'Control blood sugar',
  sideEffects: ['nausea', 'diarrhea'],
  instructions: 'Take with food'
})

// Administer medication
await medications.administerMedication({
  patientId: 'P12345',

```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Check for allergies before administration
medications.prescriptionVerified(async ({ patientId, medication }) => {
  const allergies = await medications.getAllergies({ patientId })
  const allergyMatch = allergies.find(a => a.medication === medication.name)

  if (allergyMatch) {
    await medications.reportReaction({
      patientId,
      type: 'allergy_alert',
      severity: allergyMatch.severity,
      action: 'hold_medication'
    })
  }
})

// Alert on adverse reactions
medications.responseObserved(async ({ patientId, response }) => {
  if (response.adverseEffects?.length > 0) {
    await medications.reportReaction({
      patientId,
      effects: response.adverseEffects,
      severity: response.severity,
      notifyPhysician: true
