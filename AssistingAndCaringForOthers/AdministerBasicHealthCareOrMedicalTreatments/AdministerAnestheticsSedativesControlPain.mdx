# Administer Anesthetics Sedatives Control Pain

> Business-as-Code definition for administering anesthetics and sedatives for pain control. Manages medication delivery, patient monitoring, and dosage adjustment for procedural and postoperative pain management.

## Overview

Anesthetic and sedative administration involves assessing patient needs, selecting appropriate medications, monitoring vital signs, and adjusting dosages to ensure safe and effective pain control. This definition provides actions for pain assessment, medication selection, dosage calculation, and patient monitoring, with events to trigger safety protocols and documentation workflows.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { administerAnestheticsSedativesControlPain } from '@headlessly/administer-anesthetics-sedatives-control-pain'

const anesthesia = administerAnestheticsSedativesControlPain()

// Assess patient pain before procedure
const assessment = await anesthesia.assessPain({
  patientId: 'patient-12345',
  procedureType: 'colonoscopy',
  painScale: 'numeric-0-10',
  currentLevel: 7
})

// Select appropriate sedative medication
const medication = await anesthesia.selectMedication({
  patientId: 'patient-12345',
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  procedureType: 'colonoscopy',
  patientFactors: ['age-65', 'weight-75kg', 'no-allergies'],
  sedationLevel: 'moderate-conscious'
})

// Calculate and administer initial dosage
const dosage = await anesthesia.calculateDosage({
  medicationId: medication.id,
  patientWeight: 75,
  patientAge: 65,
  targetSedationLevel: 'moderate-conscious'
})

await anesthesia.administerDrug({
  patientId: 'patient-12345',
  medicationId: medication.id,
  dosage: dosage.amount,
  route: 'intravenous',
  administeredBy: 'nurse-anesthetist-789'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Monitor vitals immediately after drug administration
anesthesia.drugAdministered(async ({ patientId, medicationId, timestamp }) => {
  await anesthesia.monitorVitals({
    patientId,
    parameters: ['heart-rate', 'blood-pressure', 'oxygen-saturation', 'respiratory-rate'],
    frequency: 'every-5-minutes',
    alertThresholds: {
      oxygenSaturation: { min: 92 },
      heartRate: { min: 50, max: 120 }
    }
  })
})

// Adjust dosage if inadequate pain control
anesthesia.vitalsMonitored(async ({ patientId, painLevel, vitalsStable }) => {
  if (painLevel > 5 && vitalsStable) {
    await anesthesia.adjustDosage({
      patientId,
      adjustmentType: 'increase',
      percentageChange: 20,
      justification: 'inadequate-pain-control'
    })
  }
})
```
