## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { administerBasicHealthCareMedical } from '@headlessly/administer-basic-health-care-medical'

const healthcare = administerBasicHealthCareMedical()

// Assess patient before treatment
const assessment = await healthcare.assessPatient({
  patientId: 'P12345',
  chiefComplaint: 'Wound care follow-up',
  symptoms: ['mild pain', 'healing incision']
})

// Take vital signs
const vitals = await healthcare.takeVitalSigns({
  patientId: 'P12345',
  bloodPressure: '120/80',
  temperature: 98.6,
  pulse: 72,
  respiration: 16
})

// Administer prescribed treatment
await healthcare.administerTreatment({
  patientId: 'P12345',
  treatmentType: 'wound care',
  procedure: 'dressing change',
  supplies: ['sterile gauze', 'adhesive tape', 'antiseptic']

```typescript
// Alert on abnormal vital signs
healthcare.vitalSignsTaken(async ({ patientId, vitals }) => {
  if (vitals.temperature > 100.4 || vitals.bloodPressure.systolic > 140) {
    await healthcare.reportChanges({
      patientId,
      type: 'abnormal_vitals',
      urgency: 'moderate',
      details: vitals
    })
