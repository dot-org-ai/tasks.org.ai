## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { treatAnimalInjuriesIllnesses } from '@headlessly/treat-animal-injuries-illnesses'

const vetCare = treatAnimalInjuriesIllnesses()

// Examine an animal patient
const exam = await vetCare.examineAnimal({
  patientId: 'animal-7823',
  species: 'canine',
  breed: 'Labrador Retriever',
  symptoms: ['limping', 'swelling-right-forelimb', 'reduced-appetite'],
  ownerId: 'owner-3341'
})

// Diagnose the condition
const diagnosis = await vetCare.diagnosCondition({
  patientId: exam.patientId,
  examId: exam.id,
  findings: 'Fractured radius with soft tissue swelling',
  diagnosticTests: ['x-ray-forelimb']
})

// Prescribe treatment
await vetCare.prescribeTreatment({
  patientId: exam.patientId,
  diagnosisId: diagnosis.id,
  medications: [{ drug: 'Carprofen', dosage: '2.2mg/kg', frequency: 'twice-daily', duration: '14-days' }],
  procedures: ['splint-application']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify owner after surgery
vetCare.surgeryPerformed(async ({ patientId, procedure, outcome }) => {
  const patient = await vetCare.findAnimalPatients({ id: patientId })
  await notify({
    to: patient.ownerId,
    message: `Surgery (${procedure}) completed for ${patient.name}. Outcome: ${outcome}`
  })
})

// Schedule follow-up for recovery monitoring
vetCare.medicationAdministered(async ({ patientId, treatmentProtocolId }) => {
  await scheduleAppointment({
    patientId,
    type: 'follow-up',
    date: addDays(new Date(), 7),
    reason: 'Recovery check and treatment assessment'
  })
