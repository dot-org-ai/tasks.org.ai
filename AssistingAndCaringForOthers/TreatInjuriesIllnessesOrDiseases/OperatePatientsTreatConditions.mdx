# Operate Patients Treat Conditions

> Business-as-Code definition for operating on patients to treat conditions. Models the surgical workflow from preoperative assessment and planning through intraoperative execution and postoperative recovery management.

## Overview

Operating on patients to treat conditions encompasses the full surgical lifecycle including preoperative evaluation, surgical planning, anesthesia coordination, intraoperative procedure execution, and postoperative care. This activity covers a wide range of surgical specialties including general surgery, orthopedics, cardiovascular, neurosurgery, and minimally invasive procedures. It involves coordinating surgical teams, managing operating room resources, documenting procedures, and monitoring patient outcomes through recovery.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { operatePatientsTreatConditions } from '@headlessly/operate-patients-treat-conditions'

const surgery = operatePatientsTreatConditions()

// Evaluate patient for surgery
const evaluation = await surgery.evaluatePatient({
  patientId: 'patient-3847',
  condition: 'herniated-lumbar-disc-L4-L5',
  assessments: ['physical-exam', 'MRI-review', 'cardiac-clearance'],
  asaClass: 2
})

// Schedule the procedure
const scheduledCase = await surgery.scheduleSurgery({
  patientId: evaluation.patientId,
  procedure: 'lumbar-microdiscectomy',
  surgeonId: 'surgeon-2294',
  date: '2026-03-15',
  estimatedDuration: 90,
  orRequirements: ['microscope', 'fluoroscopy']
})

// Perform the procedure
await surgery.performProcedure({
  caseId: scheduledCase.id,
  technique: 'minimally-invasive',
  startTime: '2026-03-15T08:00:00Z',
  findings: 'Large disc fragment compressing L5 nerve root',
  implants: []
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify referring physician after surgery
surgery.procedurePerformed(async ({ patientId, caseId, outcome }) => {
  const surgicalCase = await surgery.findSurgicalCases({ id: caseId })
  await notify({
    to: surgicalCase.referringPhysicianId,
    message: `Surgery completed for patient ${patientId}. Outcome: ${outcome}`
  })
})

// Auto-schedule follow-up after discharge
surgery.patientDischarged(async ({ patientId, caseId }) => {
  await scheduleAppointment({
    patientId,
    type: 'post-surgical-follow-up',
    date: addWeeks(new Date(), 2),
    reason: 'Wound check and recovery assessment'
  })
})
```
