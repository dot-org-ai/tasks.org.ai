## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { treatDentalProblemsDiseases } from '@headlessly/treat-dental-problems-diseases'

const dental = treatDentalProblemsDiseases()

// Conduct a dental examination
const exam = await dental.conductExam({
  patientId: 'patient-6732',
  findings: [
    { tooth: 14, condition: 'occlusal-caries', severity: 'moderate' },
    { tooth: 30, condition: 'cracked-cusp', severity: 'significant' }
  ],
  periodontalStatus: 'mild-gingivitis',
  radiographsTaken: ['bitewing-right', 'bitewing-left', 'periapical-30']
})

// Create a treatment plan
const plan = await dental.createTreatmentPlan({
  patientId: exam.patientId,
  examId: exam.id,
  procedures: [
    { tooth: 14, procedure: 'composite-restoration', priority: 1 },
    { tooth: 30, procedure: 'porcelain-crown', priority: 2 }
  ]
})

// Perform the restoration
await dental.performRestoration({
  treatmentPlanId: plan.id,
  tooth: 14,
  procedure: 'composite-restoration',
  material: 'composite-resin',
  anesthesia: 'lidocaine-2pct-epi'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Order prosthetic after restoration planning
dental.treatmentPlanCreated(async ({ patientId, procedures }) => {
  const crownProcedures = procedures.filter(p => p.procedure === 'porcelain-crown')
  for (const proc of crownProcedures) {
    await dental.orderProsthetic({
      patientId,
      tooth: proc.tooth,
      type: 'porcelain-crown',
      shade: 'A2',
      laboratory: 'precision-dental-lab'
    })
  }
})

// Schedule follow-up after extraction
dental.extractionPerformed(async ({ patientId, tooth }) => {
  await scheduleAppointment({
    patientId,
    type: 'post-extraction-check',
    date: addDays(new Date(), 7),
    reason: `Healing check for tooth ${tooth} extraction`
  })
})
```
