## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { treatChronicDiseasesDisorders } from '@headlessly/treat-chronic-diseases-disorders'

const chronicCare = treatChronicDiseasesDisorders()

// Assess current disease status
const assessment = await chronicCare.assessDiseaseStatus({
  patientId: 'patient-5612',
  condition: 'type-2-diabetes',
  metrics: { hba1c: 7.8, fastingGlucose: 145, bloodPressure: '138/88' }
})

// Create a care plan
const plan = await chronicCare.createCarePlan({
  patientId: assessment.patientId,
  condition: 'type-2-diabetes',
  goals: [
    { metric: 'HbA1c', target: 6.5, timeframe: '6-months' },
    { metric: 'blood-pressure', target: '130/80', timeframe: '3-months' }
  ],
  interventions: ['medication-adjustment', 'dietary-counseling', 'exercise-program']
})

// Prescribe medication
await chronicCare.prescribeMedication({
  patientId: 'patient-5612',
  carePlanId: plan.id,
  medications: [
    { drug: 'Metformin', dosage: '1000mg', frequency: 'twice-daily' },
    { drug: 'Lisinopril', dosage: '10mg', frequency: 'once-daily' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on concerning lab results
chronicCare.labResultsReviewed(async ({ patientId, results }) => {
  const hba1c = results.find(r => r.metric === 'HbA1c')
  if (hba1c && hba1c.value > 9.0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'care-manager',
      message: `Critical HbA1c of ${hba1c.value} for patient ${patientId} - immediate intervention needed`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-schedule follow-up after care plan creation
chronicCare.carePlanCreated(async ({ patientId, carePlanId }) => {
  await scheduleAppointment({
    patientId,
    type: 'follow-up',
    date: addWeeks(new Date(), 4),
    reason: 'Initial care plan follow-up and lab review'
  })
})
```
