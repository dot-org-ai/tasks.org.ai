const care = careAnimals()

// Record morning feeding
await care.feedAnimal({
  animalId: 'dog-2847',
  foodType: 'premium kibble',
  amount: '2 cups',
  timestamp: new Date()
})

// Monitor health during rounds
const healthCheck = await care.monitorHealth({
  animalId: 'dog-2847',
  vitals: {
    temperature: 101.5,
    heartRate: 90,
    behavior: 'alert and active'

care.healthMonitored(async ({ animalId, vitals }) => {
  if (vitals.temperature > 103 || vitals.temperature < 100) {
    await care.recordObservation({
      animalId,
      note: 'Temperature outside normal range',
      priority: 'high'
    })
