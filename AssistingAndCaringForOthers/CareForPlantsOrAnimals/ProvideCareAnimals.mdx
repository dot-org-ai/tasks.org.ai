## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { provideCareAnimals } from '@headlessly/provide-care-animals'

const care = provideCareAnimals()

// Admit animal for boarding
const admission = await care.admitAnimal({
  clientId: 'client-1847',
  animal: {
    name: 'Max',
    species: 'dog',
    breed: 'Labrador',
    age: 3
  },
  servicePlan: 'standard-boarding',
  duration: { start: '2026-02-10', end: '2026-02-17' }
})

// Deliver daily care services
await care.deliverCare({
  animalId: admission.animalId,
  services: ['feeding', 'exercise', 'medication', 'socialization']
})

// Assess welfare during care
const assessment = await care.assessWelfare({
  animalId: admission.animalId,
  metrics: {
    appetite: 'good',
    energy: 'high',
    behavior: 'friendly',
    physicalCondition: 'excellent'
  }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify owner when welfare concerns arise
care.welfareAssessed(async ({ animalId, metrics }) => {
  if (metrics.appetite === 'poor' || metrics.energy === 'low') {
    await care.communicateStatus({
      animalId,
      message: 'We noticed your pet is showing reduced appetite. Our team is monitoring closely.'
    })
  }
})

// Auto-adjust plan if repeated issues
care.planAdjusted(async ({ animalId, adjustments }) => {
  await care.documentService({
    animalId,
    note: `Care plan modified: ${adjustments.join(', ')}`,
    timestamp: new Date()
  })
})
```
