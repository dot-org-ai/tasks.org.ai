# Treat Patients Using Physical Therapy

> Business-as-Code definition for physical therapy treatment delivery. Models the complete therapy cycle from assessment through exercise prescription and progress monitoring.

## Overview

Physical therapy treatment involves evaluating patient conditions, developing therapeutic exercise programs, and providing manual therapy interventions to restore mobility, reduce pain, and improve functional capacity. This definition exposes actions for assessment, treatment planning, and outcome measurement.

| adjustTreatment | Modify plan based on patient progress and response |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| patientAssessed | Initial evaluation completed with baseline measurements |
| treatmentPlanDeveloped | Therapy plan created and approved for implementation |
| exercisesPrescribed | Exercise program documented and taught to patient |
| manualTherapyDelivered | Hands-on treatment intervention completed |
| sessionDocumented | Progress note finalized in medical record |
| outcomesMeasured | Functional status assessed and compared to baseline |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { treatPatientsUsingPhysicalTherapy } from '@headlessly/treat-patients-using-physical-therapy'

const therapy = treatPatientsUsingPhysicalTherapy()

// Assess a new patient
const assessment = await therapy.assessPatient({
  patientId: 'PT-2026-001',
  chiefComplaint: 'Lower back pain with radiating leg symptoms',
  functionalLimitations: ['Difficulty walking > 10 minutes', 'Unable to sit > 30 minutes'],
  painLevel: 7,
  rangeOfMotion: { lumbarFlexion: 30, lumbarExtension: 10 }
})

// Develop treatment plan
await therapy.developTreatmentPlan({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  goals: [
    { description: 'Reduce pain to 3/10 or less', timeframe: '4 weeks' },
    { description: 'Walk 30 minutes without pain', timeframe: '6 weeks' }
  ],
  frequency: '2x per week for 8 weeks',
  interventions: ['Manual therapy', 'Therapeutic exercise', 'Patient education']
})

// Document a therapy session
await therapy.documentSession({
  patientId: 'PT-2026-001',
  date: '2026-02-05',
  duration: 45,
  interventions: [
    'Lumbar mobilization grade III',
    'Core stabilization exercises',
    'Hamstring stretching'
  ],
  patientResponse: 'Tolerated well, pain decreased to 4/10 post-treatment'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-schedule follow-up when outcomes measured
therapy.outcomesMeasured(async ({ patientId, outcomes, goalsAchieved }) => {
  if (goalsAchieved < 50) {
    await therapy.adjustTreatment({
      patientId,
      modifications: 'Increase manual therapy frequency, reduce exercise intensity'
    })
  }
})

// Alert on missed sessions
therapy.sessionDocumented(async ({ patientId, attendanceRate }) => {
  if (attendanceRate < 70) {
    await notify({
      to: 'rehab-coordinator',
      message: `Patient ${patientId} has low attendance, may need outreach`
    })
  }
})
```
