## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { administerTherapyTreatmentsPatientsUsing } from '@headlessly/administer-therapy-treatments-patients-using'

const therapy = administerTherapyTreatmentsPatientsUsing()

// Assess functional status
const assessment = await therapy.assessFunctionalStatus({
  patientId: 'PT12345',
  sessionId: 'S001',
  rangeOfMotion: { shoulder: '0-90 degrees', limited: true },
  strength: { grade: '3/5', weakness: 'shoulder abduction' },
  pain: { level: 6, scale: '0-10', location: 'left shoulder' },
  function: { difficulty: 'reaching overhead', adl: 'limited' }
})

// Apply manual therapy
await therapy.applyManualTherapy({
  patientId: 'PT12345',
  sessionId: 'S001',
  technique: 'joint mobilization',
  target: 'glenohumeral joint',
  grade: 'grade III',
  duration: 10,
  patientResponse: 'improved ROM, decreased pain to 4/10'
})

// Utilize therapeutic modality
await therapy.utilizeTherapeuticModality({
  patientId: 'PT12345',
  sessionId: 'S001',
  modality: 'moist heat pack',
  location: 'left shoulder',
  duration: 15,
  temperature: 'medium',
  effect: 'muscle relaxation, pain reduction'
})

// Guide therapeutic exercise
await therapy.guideTherapeuticExercise({
  patientId: 'PT12345',
  sessionId: 'S001',
  exercises: [
    { name: 'pendulum swing', sets: 2, reps: 10, assistance: 'minimal' },
    { name: 'wall climb', sets: 3, reps: 8, progression: 'increased height' }
  ],
  tolerance: 'good, no pain exacerbation'
})

// Fit adaptive equipment
await therapy.fitAdaptiveEquipment({
  patientId: 'PT12345',
  equipment: 'reacher/grabber',
  reason: 'compensate for limited shoulder ROM',
  training: 'proper use demonstrated',
  patientUnderstanding: 'excellent'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Track progress toward discharge goals
therapy.progressMeasured(async ({ patientId, measures }) => {
  const plan = await therapy.getTherapyPlans({ patientId })
  const goalAchievement = assessGoals(measures, plan.goals)

  if (goalAchievement >= 80) {
    await therapy.recommendDischarge({
      patientId,
      achievement: goalAchievement,
      homeProgram: true
    })
  }
})

// Alert on adverse patient responses
therapy.manualTherapyApplied(async ({ patientId, response }) => {
  if (response.includes('increased pain') || response.includes('new symptoms')) {
    await therapy.modifyTreatment({
      patientId,
      alert: 'adverse response',
      notifyPhysician: true
    })
  }
})
```
