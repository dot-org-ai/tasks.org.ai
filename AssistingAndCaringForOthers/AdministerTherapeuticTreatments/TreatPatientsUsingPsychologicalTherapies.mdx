## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { treatPatientsUsingPsychologicalTherapies } from '@headlessly/treat-patients-using-psychological-therapies'

const therapy = treatPatientsUsingPsychologicalTherapies()

// Conduct intake assessment
const intake = await therapy.conductIntake({
  patientId: 'PT-778899',
  presentingProblems: ['generalized-anxiety', 'panic-attacks'],
  symptomSeverity: 7,
  priorTherapy: true,
  medications: ['sertraline-50mg'],
  suicidalIdeation: false
})

// Develop evidence-based treatment plan
const plan = await therapy.developTreatmentPlan({
  patientId: 'PT-778899',
  diagnosis: 'generalized-anxiety-disorder',
  modality: 'cognitive-behavioral-therapy',
  goals: [
    'reduce-anxiety-severity-by-50-percent',
    'eliminate-panic-attacks',
    'develop-coping-strategies'
  ],
  sessionFrequency: 'weekly',
  estimatedDuration: 16
})

// Deliver therapy session
await therapy.deliverTherapy({
  planId: plan.id,
  sessionNumber: 5,
  interventions: [
    { technique: 'cognitive-restructuring', duration: 20 },
    { technique: 'exposure-hierarchy', duration: 25 },
    { technique: 'relaxation-training', duration: 10 }
  ],
  homework: 'practice-diaphragmatic-breathing-daily',
  patientEngagement: 'high'
})

// Measure treatment outcomes
const outcomes = await therapy.measureOutcomes({
  planId: plan.id,
  assessmentType: 'GAD-7',
  score: 11,
  comparedToBaseline: -8
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on concerning clinical indicators
therapy.intakeConducted(async ({ patientId, suicidalIdeation, riskLevel }) => {
  if (riskLevel === 'high') {
    await notify({
      to: 'crisis-team',
      urgent: true,
      message: `High-risk patient ${patientId} requires immediate safety planning`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-schedule outcome assessment
therapy.sessionDocumented(async ({ planId, sessionNumber }) => {
  if (sessionNumber % 8 === 0) {
    await therapy.measureOutcomes({
      planId,
      assessmentType: 'PHQ-9',
      scheduledDate: nextSessionDate(planId)
    })
  }
})
```
