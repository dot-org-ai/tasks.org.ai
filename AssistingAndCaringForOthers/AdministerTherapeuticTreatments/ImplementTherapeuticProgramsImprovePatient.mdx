## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { implementTherapeuticProgramsImprovePatient } from '@headlessly/implement-therapeutic-programs-improve-patient'

const therapy = implementTherapeuticProgramsImprovePatient()

// Develop treatment plan for stroke recovery
const plan = await therapy.developPlan({
  patientId: 'PT-991234',
  diagnosis: 'cerebrovascular-accident',
  functionalLimitations: ['left-hemiparesis', 'gait-impairment'],
  goals: [
    'ambulate-50-feet-independently',
    'climb-stairs-with-rail',
    'transfer-bed-to-chair-safely'
  ],
  frequencyWeeks: 12,
  sessionsPerWeek: 3
})

// Conduct therapy session
await therapy.conductIntervention({
  planId: plan.id,
  sessionNumber: 5,
  activities: [
    { exercise: 'gait-training', duration: 20, assistLevel: 'contact-guard' },
    { exercise: 'balance-exercises', duration: 15, assistLevel: 'minimal' },
    { exercise: 'lower-extremity-strengthening', duration: 15, reps: 10 }
  ],
  patientTolerance: 'good',
  painLevel: 2
})

// Measure progress at 4-week mark
const assessment = await therapy.measureProgress({
  planId: plan.id,
  assessmentType: 'timed-up-and-go',
  score: 18,
  comparedToBaseline: -7
})

// Adjust protocol based on progress
if (assessment.improvementPercentage > 30) {
  await therapy.adjustProtocol({
    planId: plan.id,
    changes: ['increase-gait-distance', 'reduce-assist-level', 'add-stair-training']
  })
}
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert therapist to schedule reassessment
therapy.progressMeasured(async ({ planId, sessionCount }) => {
  if (sessionCount % 12 === 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'assigned-therapist',
      message: `Comprehensive reassessment due for plan ${planId}`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-generate home exercise program
therapy.protocolAdjusted(async ({ planId, patientId }) => {
  await therapy.prescribeHomeExercises({
    planId,
    patientId,
    exercises: await generateHomeProgram({ planId }),
    frequency: 'daily',
    instructionsProvided: true
  })
})
```
