# Prepare Patients Physically Medical Procedures

> Business-as-Code definition for readying patients' bodies and physical state prior to medical procedures through skin preparation, removal of accessories, fasting verification, and pre-procedural assessments.

## Overview

Physical patient preparation encompasses all activities to ensure patient readiness for procedures, including skin cleansing, hair removal, jewelry removal, bowel preparation, fasting compliance, and baseline vital sign assessment. This definition models the complete pre-procedure workflow from initial assessment through final verification before procedure start.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { preparePatientsPhysicallyMedicalProcedures } from '@headlessly/prepare-patients-physically-medical-procedures'

const preparation = preparePatientsPhysicallyMedicalProcedures()

// Verify pre-procedure instructions compliance
const verification = await preparation.verifyInstructions({
  patientId: 'PT-667788',
  procedureType: 'colonoscopy',
  bowelPrepCompleted: true,
  fastingSince: '2026-02-04T22:00:00Z',
  medicationsHeld: ['aspirin', 'warfarin']
})

// Assess baseline status
await preparation.assessBaseline({
  patientId: 'PT-667788',
  vitalSigns: {
    bloodPressure: '132/78',
    heartRate: 68,
    temperature: 98.2,
    oxygenSaturation: 98
  },
  weight: 185,
  allergies: ['penicillin']
})

// Remove accessories and secure belongings
await preparation.removeAccessories({
  patientId: 'PT-667788',
  itemsRemoved: [
    { item: 'wedding-ring', secured: 'taped-to-finger' },
    { item: 'partial-denture', secured: 'labeled-container' },
    { item: 'hearing-aid', secured: 'bedside-drawer' }
  ],
  valuablesInventory: 'completed'
})

// Prepare skin for procedure
await preparation.prepareSkin({
  patientId: 'PT-667788',
  procedureType: 'colonoscopy',
  sitePrep: 'perineal-cleansing',
  solution: 'chlorhexidine',
  preparedBy: 'RN-Thompson'
})

// Verify fasting compliance
await preparation.verifyFasting({
  patientId: 'PT-667788',
  lastOralIntake: '2026-02-04T22:00:00Z',
  hoursNPO: 10,
  compliant: true
})

// Provide procedure draping
await preparation.provideDraping({
  patientId: 'PT-667788',
  gownProvided: 'open-back',
  privacyDraping: 'applied',
  warmBlankets: 2
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on abnormal baseline vitals
preparation.baselineAssessed(async ({ patientId, vitalSigns }) => {
  if (vitalSigns.systolic > 180 || vitalSigns.diastolic > 110) {
    await notify({
      to: 'anesthesia-provider',
      urgent: true,
      message: `Elevated BP in patient ${patientId} - review before procedure`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-delay procedure for fasting non-compliance
preparation.fastingVerified(async ({ patientId, compliant, lastOralIntake }) => {
  if (!compliant) {
    await delayProcedure({
      patientId,
      reason: 'npo-non-compliance',
      lastIntake: lastOralIntake,
      minimumDelay: 2
    })
    await notifyScheduling({
      patientId,
      action: 'reschedule-required'
    })
  }
})
```
