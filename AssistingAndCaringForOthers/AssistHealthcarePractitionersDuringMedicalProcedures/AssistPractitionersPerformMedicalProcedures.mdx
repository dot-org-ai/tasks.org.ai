## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { assistPractitionersPerformMedicalProcedures } from '@headlessly/assist-practitioners-perform-medical-procedures'

const procedures = assistPractitionersPerformMedicalProcedures()

// Prepare room for colonoscopy
const setup = await procedures.prepareProcedureRoom({
  procedureId: 'PROC-2026-789',
  procedureType: 'Colonoscopy',
  equipmentNeeded: ['Colonoscope', 'Monitor', 'Insufflator', 'Suction'],
  suppliesNeeded: ['Biopsy forceps', 'Polypectomy snare', 'Specimen traps'],
  medications: ['Propofol', 'Midazolam', 'Fentanyl']
})

// Obtain informed consent
await procedures.obtainConsent({
  procedureId: 'PROC-2026-789',
  patientId: 'PT-2026-456',
  procedureExplained: true,
  risksDisclosed: ['Bleeding', 'Perforation', 'Sedation complications'],
  alternativesDiscussed: true,
  patientSignature: true,
  witnessSignature: true
})

// Position patient for procedure
await procedures.positionPatient({
  procedureId: 'PROC-2026-789',
  position: 'Left lateral decubitus',
  safetyVerified: true,
  accessOptimized: true,
  comfortMeasures: ['Pillow between knees', 'Blanket for warmth']
})

// Collect biopsy specimens
await procedures.collectSpecimens({
  procedureId: 'PROC-2026-789',
  specimens: [
    { site: 'Ascending colon', type: 'Biopsy', container: 'Formalin jar 1' },
    { site: 'Sigmoid colon', type: 'Polyp', container: 'Formalin jar 2' }
  ],
  labTests: ['Histopathology']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Route specimens to laboratory
procedures.specimensCollected(async ({ procedureId, specimens }) => {
  for (const specimen of specimens) {
    await routeToLab({
      procedureId,
      specimenId: specimen.id,
      labTests: specimen.tests,
      priority: specimen.urgent ? 'stat' : 'routine'
    })
  }
})

// Alert on abnormal vital signs during procedure
procedures.patientMonitored(async ({ procedureId, vitals }) => {
  const alerts = []
  if (vitals.oxygenSaturation < 90) alerts.push('Low O2 saturation')
  if (vitals.heartRate > 120) alerts.push('Elevated heart rate')
  if (vitals.bloodPressureSystolic < 90) alerts.push('Hypotension')

  if (alerts.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'procedure-team',
      priority: 'urgent',
      message: `Patient alerts in ${procedureId}: ${alerts.join(', ')}`
    })
  }
})
```
