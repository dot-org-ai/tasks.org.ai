## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { assistHealthcarePractitionersDuringExaminations } from '@headlessly/assist-healthcare-practitioners-during-examinations'

const assistance = assistHealthcarePractitionersDuringExaminations()

// Prepare examination room for routine physical
await assistance.prepareRoom({
  roomNumber: '3B',
  examinationType: 'annual-physical',
  practitionerId: 'MD-Williams',
  supplies: [
    'examination-gown',
    'blood-pressure-cuff',
    'stethoscope',
    'otoscope',
    'reflex-hammer'
  ]
})

// Verify consent before gynecological exam
await assistance.verifyConsent({
  patientId: 'PT-556677',
  procedureType: 'pelvic-examination',
  consentSigned: true,
  chaperoneRequested: true
})

// Assist with positioning for examination
await assistance.assistPositioning({
  patientId: 'PT-556677',
  position: 'lithotomy',
  drapingProvided: true,
  patientComfort: 'confirmed'
})

// Hand instruments during procedure
await assistance.handInstruments({
  practitionerId: 'MD-Williams',
  instrumentSequence: [
    'speculum',
    'cytobrush',
    'spatula'
  ],
  timing: 'as-requested'
})

// Collect specimens for lab
await assistance.collectSpecimens({
  patientId: 'PT-556677',
  specimens: [
    { type: 'cervical-cytology', container: 'liquid-based', labeled: true },
    { type: 'chlamydia-screening', container: 'swab-tube', labeled: true }
  ],
  labDestination: 'pathology'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-notify lab when specimens ready
assistance.specimensCollected(async ({ patientId, specimens, labDestination }) => {
  await notify({
    to: labDestination,
    message: `${specimens.length} specimens ready for pickup`,
    priority: 'routine'
  })
})

// Track room turnover time
assistance.roomCleaned(async ({ roomNumber, timestamp }) => {
  const prepared = await getPreparedTime(roomNumber)
  const turnoverTime = timestamp - prepared
  await logMetric({
    metric: 'room-turnover',
    room: roomNumber,
    duration: turnoverTime
  })
})
```
