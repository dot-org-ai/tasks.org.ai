## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { provideFirstAidRescueAssistance } from '@headlessly/provide-first-aid-rescue-assistance'

const rescue = provideFirstAidRescueAssistance()

// Assess hazards at rescue scene
const hazards = await rescue.assessHazards({
  incidentId: 'RESCUE-789',
  location: 'industrial warehouse, confined space',
  environmentalRisks: ['oxygen deficiency', 'chemical vapors', 'structural instability'],
  victimCount: 2,
  responderSafety: 'requires SCBA and harness'
})

// Establish incident command
await rescue.establishIncidentCommand({
  incidentId: 'RESCUE-789',
  incidentCommander: 'Battalion Chief Johnson',
  agencies: ['fire department', 'hazmat', 'EMS'],
  unifiedCommand: true
})

// Execute confined space rescue
await rescue.executeRescue({
  incidentId: 'RESCUE-789',
  rescueType: 'confined space',
  method: 'vertical extraction with tripod',
  ppe: ['SCBA', 'full body harness', 'helmet', 'gloves'],
  safetyLine: true,
  victimCondition: 'unconscious, breathing'
})

// Provide immediate care after extraction
await rescue.provideImmediateCare({
  incidentId: 'RESCUE-789',
  victimId: 'V1',
  assessment: {
    airway: 'patent',
    breathing: 'shallow, 10/min',
    circulation: 'weak pulse, 110 bpm'
  },
  interventions: [
    'high-flow oxygen via non-rebreather',
    'spinal immobilization',
    'monitor vital signs'
  ]
})

// Decontaminate after chemical exposure
await rescue.decontaminateVictim({
  incidentId: 'RESCUE-456',
  victimId: 'V2',
  contaminant: 'industrial solvent',
  method: 'water rinse, clothing removal',
  deconTeam: 'hazmat',
  cleared: true
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Activate specialized teams based on hazard type
rescue.hazardsAssessed(async ({ incidentId, hazards }) => {
  if (hazards.includes('hazardous materials')) {
    await rescue.coordinateAgencies({
      incidentId,
      requestTeam: 'hazmat',
      urgency: 'immediate'
    })
  }
  if (hazards.includes('water rescue')) {
    await rescue.coordinateAgencies({
      incidentId,
      requestTeam: 'swift water rescue',
      urgency: 'immediate'
    })
  }
})

// Transition to EMS after rescue completion
rescue.immediateCareProvided(async ({ incidentId, victimId, condition }) => {
  await rescue.coordinateAgencies({
    incidentId,
    transferTo: 'EMS',
    victimId,
    condition,
    transportDestination: determineDestination(condition)
  })
})
```
