## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { administerFirstAid } from '@headlessly/administer-first-aid'

const firstAid = administerFirstAid()

// Assess emergency scene
const scene = await firstAid.assessScene({
  location: 'warehouse floor 2',
  hazards: ['electrical equipment nearby'],
  safeToApproach: true,
  numberOfVictims: 1
})

// Perform primary assessment
const assessment = await firstAid.performPrimaryAssessment({
  incidentId: scene.incidentId,
  airway: 'patent',
  breathing: 'adequate, 18/min',
  circulation: 'rapid pulse, active bleeding right arm',
  consciousness: 'alert and oriented'
})

// Control bleeding
await firstAid.controlBleeding({
  incidentId: scene.incidentId,
  location: 'right forearm laceration',
  method: 'direct pressure',
  dressing: 'sterile gauze',
  bleedingControlled: true
})

// Activate EMS
await firstAid.activateEMS({
  incidentId: scene.incidentId,
  urgency: 'moderate',
  chiefComplaint: 'laceration with controlled bleeding',
  vitals: assessment.vitals,
  treatmentProvided: 'bleeding control, wound dressing'
})

// Stabilize fracture
await firstAid.stabilizeInjury({
  incidentId: 'INC002',
  injuryType: 'suspected wrist fracture',
  method: 'rigid splint',
  position: 'neutral',
  distalCirculation: 'intact'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-activate EMS for critical conditions
firstAid.primaryAssessmentPerformed(async ({ incidentId, assessment }) => {
  if (!assessment.breathing || !assessment.circulation || assessment.consciousness === 'unresponsive') {
    await firstAid.activateEMS({
      incidentId,
      urgency: 'critical',
      lifeThreat: true,
      assessment
    })
  }
})

// Document all incidents for safety review
firstAid.emsActivated(async ({ incidentId, transferredTo }) => {
  await firstAid.documentIncident({
    incidentId,
    timestamp: new Date(),
    careProvided: await getInterventions(incidentId),
    outcome: 'transferred to EMS',
    emsUnit: transferredTo
  })
})
```
