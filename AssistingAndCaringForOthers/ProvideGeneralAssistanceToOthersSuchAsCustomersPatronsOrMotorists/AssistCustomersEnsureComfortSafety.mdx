```typescript
import { assistCustomersEnsureComfortSafety } from '@headlessly/assist-customers-ensure-comfort-safety'

const comfort = assistCustomersEnsureComfortSafety()

// Log a comfort request
const request = await comfort.logComfortRequest({
  guestId: 'g-5012',
  area: 'lobby-east',
  issue: 'temperature-too-cold',
  priority: 'normal'
})

// Perform an environment check
const check = await comfort.performEnvironmentCheck({

// Auto-assign floor attendant on new request
comfort.comfortRequestLogged(async ({ area, priority }) => {
  const attendant = await findAvailableAttendant(area)
  await assignTask({ attendantId: attendant.id, area, priority })
})

// Alert safety officer on hazard report
comfort.hazardReported(async ({ area, hazardType, severity }) => {
  if (severity === 'high') {
    await notify({
      to: 'safety-officer',
      message: `High-severity ${hazardType} hazard reported in ${area}`
    })
  }
})
