### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { assistCustomersSeatingArrangements } from '@headlessly/assist-customers-seating-arrangements'

const seating = assistCustomersSeatingArrangements()

// Check availability for tonight
const tables = await seating.checkAvailability({
  date: '2026-02-05',
  time: '19:00',
  partySize: 4
})

// Seat a walk-in party
await seating.seatGuest({
  tableId: tables[0].id,
  partySize: 4,
  guestName: 'Martinez'
})

// Create a future reservation
await seating.createReservation({

// Notify next waitlist party when table clears
seating.tableCleared(async ({ tableId, capacity }) => {
  const next = await seating.getWaitList({ minPartySize: 1, maxPartySize: capacity })
  if (next.length > 0) {
    await notify({ to: next[0].phone, message: 'Your table is ready!' })
  }
})

// Track peak turnover times
seating.guestSeated(async ({ tableId, time }) => {
  await logMetric({ event: 'guest-seated', tableId, time })
})
```
