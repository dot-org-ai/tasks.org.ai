## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { assistPassengersDuringVehicleBoarding } from '@headlessly/assist-passengers-during-vehicle-boarding'

const boarding = assistPassengersDuringVehicleBoarding()

// Call a boarding group
await boarding.callBoardingGroup({
  flightId: 'FL-1042',
  group: 1,
  description: 'First class and pre-board passengers'
})

// Scan a boarding pass
const scan = await boarding.scanBoardingPass({
  flightId: 'FL-1042',
  passengerId: 'pax-8821',
  boardingPass: 'BP-2026-1042-8821'
})

// Reconcile the manifest before departure
const reconciliation = await boarding.reconcileManifest({
  flightId: 'FL-1042'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-request mobility support for pre-arranged needs
boarding.boardingGroupCalled(async ({ flightId, group }) => {
  const requests = await boarding.findMobilityRequests({ flightId, group })
  for (const req of requests) {
    await boarding.provideMobilitySupport({ requestId: req.id })
  }
})

// Alert operations on missing passengers
boarding.manifestReconciled(async ({ flightId, missing }) => {
  if (missing.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'gate-operations',
      message: `${missing.length} passengers not boarded for ${flightId}`
    })
  }
})
```
