### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { greetCustomersPatronsVisitors } from '@headlessly/greet-customers-patrons-visitors'

const greeting = greetCustomersPatronsVisitors()

// Check in a visitor
const record = await greeting.checkInVisitor({
  name: 'Jane Doe',
  company: 'Acme Corp',
  hostContact: 'john.smith@company.com',
  purpose: 'scheduled-meeting'
})

// Verify their appointment
const appointment = await greeting.verifyAppointment({
  visitorId: record.id,
  hostEmail: 'john.smith@company.com'
})

// Issue a badge and notify the host
await greeting.issuePass({ visitorId: record.id, accessLevel: 'guest' })
await greeting.notifyHost({ appointmentId: appointment.id })

// Send welcome message upon check-in
greeting.visitorCheckedIn(async ({ visitorId, name }) => {
  await sendSMS({
    to: name,
    message: 'Welcome! Your host has been notified and will be with you shortly.'
  })
})

// Auto-escalate long wait times
greeting.waitListUpdated(async ({ visitorId, waitMinutes }) => {
  if (waitMinutes > 10) {
    await notify({
      to: 'floor-manager',
      message: `Visitor ${visitorId} has been waiting over 10 minutes`
    })
  }
})
```
