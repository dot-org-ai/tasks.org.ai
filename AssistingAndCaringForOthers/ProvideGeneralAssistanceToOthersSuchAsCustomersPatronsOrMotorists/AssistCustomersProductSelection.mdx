// Assess customer needs
const needs = await selection.assessNeeds({
  customerId: 'cust-910',
  category: 'laptops',
  requirements: ['portability', '16GB-RAM', 'long-battery'],
  budget: { max: 1500 }

// Track recommendation conversion rates
selection.decisionRecorded(async ({ customerId, recommendedProductId, purchasedProductId }) => {
  await logMetric({

    matched: recommendedProductId === purchasedProductId,
    customerId
  })
})

// Notify specialist for complex product categories

    await notify({
      to: 'product-specialist',
      message: `High-complexity ${category} consultation requested`
    })
  }
