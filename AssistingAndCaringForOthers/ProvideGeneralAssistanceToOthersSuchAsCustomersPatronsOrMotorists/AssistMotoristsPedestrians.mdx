## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { assistMotoristsPedestrians } from '@headlessly/assist-motorists-pedestrians'

const assist = assistMotoristsPedestrians()

// Log a roadside assistance request
const request = await assist.createRequest({
  type: 'motorist',
  issue: 'flat-tire',
  location: { lat: 40.7128, lng: -74.006 },
  vehicleDescription: '2024 Honda Civic, silver'
})

// Dispatch a service technician
await assist.dispatchService({
  requestId: request.id,
  unit: 'RST-14',
  estimatedArrival: '15 minutes'
})

// Close the request after resolution
await assist.closeRequest({
  requestId: request.id,
  resolution: 'tire-changed',
  duration: 22
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-dispatch nearest available unit
assist.requestCreated(async ({ requestId, location, issue }) => {
  const nearestUnit = await findNearestUnit(location)
  await assist.dispatchService({ requestId, unit: nearestUnit.id })
})

// Alert supervisor on emergency escalation
assist.emergencyEscalated(async ({ requestId, location }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'shift-supervisor',
    message: `Emergency escalation at ${location.address} for request ${requestId}`
  })
})
```
