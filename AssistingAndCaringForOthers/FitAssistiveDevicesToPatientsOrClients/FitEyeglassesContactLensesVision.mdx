# Fit Eyeglasses Contact Lenses Vision

> Business-as-Code definition for fitting eyeglasses, contact lenses, or other vision aids. Models the optical dispensing workflow from prescription interpretation and frame selection through lens fabrication, fitting adjustments, and patient education.

## Overview

Fitting eyeglasses, contact lenses, or other vision aids involves interpreting optical prescriptions, helping patients select appropriate frames and lens options, taking precise measurements, ordering or fabricating lenses, performing fittings, and making adjustments to ensure comfort and visual accuracy. This activity spans optometric and ophthalmologic practices, retail optical shops, and specialty low-vision clinics, covering standard corrective lenses, progressive multifocals, contact lenses, sports eyewear, and assistive vision devices.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { fitEyeglassesContactLensesVision } from '@headlessly/fit-eyeglasses-contact-lenses-vision'

const optical = fitEyeglassesContactLensesVision()

// Interpret the prescription
const rx = await optical.interpretPrescription({
  patientId: 'patient-4238',
  prescription: {
    rightEye: { sphere: -2.50, cylinder: -0.75, axis: 180 },
    leftEye: { sphere: -3.00, cylinder: -0.50, axis: 170 },
    add: 1.50,
    prescriberId: 'dr-optometrist-118'
  }
})

// Select frame and take measurements
const frame = await optical.selectFrame({
  patientId: rx.patientId,
  frameId: 'frame-rayban-5228',
  size: '53-17-140',
  color: 'dark-havana'
})

const measurements = await optical.takeMeasurements({
  patientId: rx.patientId,
  frameId: frame.id,
  pupillaryDistance: 63,
  segmentHeight: 18,
  vertexDistance: 12
})

// Order lenses
await optical.orderLenses({
  patientId: rx.patientId,
  prescriptionId: rx.id,
  frameId: frame.id,
  measurements: measurements.id,
  lensType: 'progressive',
  material: 'polycarbonate',
  coatings: ['anti-reflective', 'scratch-resistant', 'UV-protection']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify patient when lenses are ready
optical.lensesOrdered(async ({ patientId, orderId, estimatedReady }) => {
  await notify({
    to: patientId,
    message: `Your lenses have been ordered and will be ready by ${estimatedReady}`
  })
})

// Schedule follow-up for contact lens fittings
optical.contactLensesFitted(async ({ patientId, lensType }) => {
  await scheduleAppointment({
    patientId,
    type: 'contact-lens-follow-up',
    date: addWeeks(new Date(), 1),
    reason: 'Assess comfort and fit of new contact lenses'
  })
})
```
