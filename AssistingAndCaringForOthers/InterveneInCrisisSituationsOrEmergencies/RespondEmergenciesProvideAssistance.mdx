## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { respondEmergenciesProvideAssistance } from '@headlessly/respond-emergencies-provide-assistance'

const response = respondEmergenciesProvideAssistance()

// Receive emergency call
const call = await response.receiveCall({
  caller: { phone: '555-0123', location: '789 Oak Avenue' },
  incidentType: 'structure fire',
  urgency: 'critical',
  details: 'Residential home, smoke visible, occupants inside'
})

// Dispatch appropriate units
await response.dispatchUnits({
  callId: call.id,
  units: [
    { type: 'engine', id: 'E-14', personnel: 4 },
    { type: 'ladder', id: 'L-7', personnel: 3 },
    { type: 'ambulance', id: 'M-22', personnel: 2 }
  ]
})

// Assess scene upon arrival
const assessment = await response.assessScene({
  callId: call.id,
  conditions: {
    fire: 'active, second floor',
    victims: 'two adults evacuated, one child missing',
    hazards: ['propane tank', 'power lines']
  }
})

// Provide assistance based on assessment
await response.provideAssistance({
  incidentId: assessment.incidentId,
  activities: ['fire suppression', 'search and rescue', 'medical evaluation']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-dispatch additional units based on scene assessment
response.sceneAssessed(async ({ incidentId, conditions }) => {
  if (conditions.victims.includes('missing')) {
    await response.coordinateAgencies({
      incidentId,
      agencies: ['search and rescue', 'police']
    })
  }
})

// Alert hospital when patients incoming
response.assistanceProvided(async ({ incidentId, activities }) => {
  const medicalCases = activities.filter(a => a.type === 'medical transport')
  if (medicalCases.length > 0) {
    await notifyHospital({
      incidentId,
      patientCount: medicalCases.length,
      severity: 'urgent'
    })
  }
})

// Generate report when incident resolved
response.incidentManaged(async ({ incidentId, status }) => {
  if (status === 'resolved') {
    await response.reportStatus({
      incidentId,
      report: 'full incident documentation'
    })
  }
})
```
