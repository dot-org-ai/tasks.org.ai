## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { assistOthersDuringEmergencies } from '@headlessly/assist-others-during-emergencies'

const emergency = assistOthersDuringEmergencies()

// Assess emergency situation
const assessment = await emergency.assessSituation({
  location: '123 Main Street',
  incidentType: 'vehicle collision',
  victimCount: 2,
  threats: ['traffic', 'fuel leak']
})

// Ensure victim safety first
await emergency.ensureSafety({
  incidentId: assessment.id,
  actions: ['stop traffic', 'move victims away from vehicles']
})

// Contact emergency services
await emergency.contactServices({
  incidentId: assessment.id,
  services: ['ambulance', 'fire department', 'police'],
  urgency: 'high'
})

// Provide first aid while waiting
await emergency.provideFirstAid({
  incidentId: assessment.id,
  victimId: 'victim-1',
  treatment: ['apply pressure to wound', 'monitor breathing']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert dispatch immediately after assessment
emergency.situationAssessed(async ({ incidentId, severity, threats }) => {
  if (severity === 'critical' || threats.length > 0) {
    await emergency.contactServices({
      incidentId,
      services: ['ambulance', 'fire', 'police'],
      urgency: 'critical'
    })
  }
})

// Document all first aid provided
emergency.firstAidProvided(async ({ incidentId, victimId, treatment }) => {
  await emergency.documentIncident({
    incidentId,
    entry: {
      timestamp: new Date(),
      action: 'first aid',
      victim: victimId,
      details: treatment
    }
  })
})

// Notify family when situation stabilizes
emergency.handoffCoordinated(async ({ incidentId, victims }) => {
  for (const victim of victims) {
    await notifyFamily({
      victimId: victim.id,
      status: victim.condition,
      destination: victim.transportedTo
    })
  }
})
```
