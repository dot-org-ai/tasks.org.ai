## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { provideBasicNeedsChildren } from '@headlessly/provide-basic-needs-children'

const childcare = provideBasicNeedsChildren()

// Assess a child's current needs
const assessment = await childcare.assessNeeds({
  childId: 'CHILD-2026-0789',
  areas: ['nutrition', 'hygiene', 'safety', 'development']
})

// Prepare and provide a meal
await childcare.prepareMeal({
  childId: 'CHILD-2026-0789',
  mealType: 'lunch',
  dietaryRestrictions: ['nut-free', 'dairy-free'],
  servingTime: '12:00'
})

// Document daily care activities
await childcare.documentCare({
  childId: 'CHILD-2026-0789',
  date: '2026-02-05',
  activities: ['breakfast', 'outdoor-play', 'nap', 'hygiene'],
  observations: 'Active participation in group activities'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert caregivers when incidents occur
childcare.incidentReported(async ({ childId, incident, severity }) => {
  if (severity === 'high') {
    await notify({
      to: ['parent', 'supervisor', 'health-provider'],
      message: `Incident reported for child ${childId}: ${incident.description}`
    })
  }
})

// Track developmental milestones
childcare.milestoneReached(async ({ childId, milestone }) => {
  await updateRecord({
    childId,
    milestoneType: milestone.category,
    achievedDate: new Date()
  })
})

// Monitor nutritional patterns
childcare.mealProvided(async ({ childId, amountConsumed, mealType }) => {
  if (amountConsumed < 50) {
    const recentMeals = await childcare.getCareSchedules({
      childId,
      activityType: 'meals',
      daysBack: 3
    })

    const lowIntakeCount = recentMeals.filter(m => m.amountConsumed < 50).length
    if (lowIntakeCount >= 4) {
      await childcare.assessNeeds({
        childId,
        focusArea: 'nutrition',
        reason: 'Consistently low meal intake'
      })
    }
  }
})
```
