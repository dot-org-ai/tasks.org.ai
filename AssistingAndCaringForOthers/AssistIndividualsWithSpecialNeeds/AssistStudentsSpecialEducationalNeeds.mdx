## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { assistStudentsSpecialEducationalNeeds } from '@headlessly/assist-students-special-educational-needs'

const support = assistStudentsSpecialEducationalNeeds()

// Implement IEP accommodations
await support.implementIEP({
  studentId: 'student-4512',
  accommodations: [
    'extended time on assessments',
    'preferential seating',
    'assistive technology for writing'
  ],
  services: [
    { type: 'speech therapy', frequency: '2x per week' },
    { type: 'occupational therapy', frequency: '1x per week' }
  ]
})

// Provide direct support during instruction
await support.provideSupport({
  studentId: 'student-4512',
  activity: 'math lesson',
  assistance: [
    'read word problems aloud',
    'provide manipulatives',
    'break tasks into steps'
  ]
})

// Monitor progress toward IEP goals
const progress = await support.monitorProgress({
  studentId: 'student-4512',
  goals: [
    { id: 'reading-fluency', current: 75, target: 100, unit: 'words per minute' },
    { id: 'social-interaction', current: 'improving', target: 'proficient' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert team when progress falls behind
support.progressMonitored(async ({ studentId, goals }) => {
  const behindGoals = goals.filter(g => g.percentComplete < 50 && g.timeline < 50)
  if (behindGoals.length > 0) {
    await support.coordinateTeam({
      studentId,
      meeting: {
        purpose: 'discuss progress concerns',
        attendees: ['parent', 'educator', 'specialist']
      }
    })
  }
})

// Adjust support when accommodations ineffective
support.supportProvided(async ({ studentId, effectiveness }) => {
  if (effectiveness === 'low') {
    await support.adjustSupport({
      studentId,
      changes: 'increase frequency of check-ins and provide additional scaffolding'
    })
  }
})

// Document all services for compliance
support.supportProvided(async ({ studentId, activity, assistance }) => {
  await support.documentServices({
    studentId,
    entry: {
      timestamp: new Date(),
      activity,
      assistance,
      duration: '30 minutes'
