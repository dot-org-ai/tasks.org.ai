### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { developDailySchedulesChildrenFamilies } from '@headlessly/develop-daily-schedules-children-families'

const scheduling = developDailySchedulesChildrenFamilies()

// Assess child and family scheduling needs
const assessment = await scheduling.assessNeeds({
  childId: 'CH-2026-998877',
  age: 5,
  diagnoses: ['autism-spectrum-disorder', 'speech-delay'],
  therapies: ['speech-therapy', 'occupational-therapy', 'applied-behavior-analysis'],
  schoolSchedule: 'half-day-preschool',
  familyConstraints: ['working-parents', 'sibling-activities'],

})

// Coordinate therapy and medical services
await scheduling.coordinateServices({

```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-adjust when therapy cancelled
scheduling.servicesCoordinated(async ({ childId, services }) => {
  for (const service of services) {
    if (service.status === 'cancelled') {
      await scheduling.adjustSchedule({
        childId,
        modification: 'reschedule-therapy',
        serviceType: service.type,
        proposedTimes: await findAlternativeSlots(childId, service)
      })
    }
  }
})

// Monitor schedule adherence and flag issues
scheduling.adherenceMonitored(async ({ childId, scheduleId, adherenceRate }) => {
  if (adherenceRate < 70) {
    await notify({
      to: 'care-coordinator',
      message: `Low schedule adherence (${adherenceRate}%) for child ${childId}`,
      action: 'review-and-modify-schedule'
    })
  }
})

// Alert family of upcoming schedule changes
scheduling.scheduleAdjusted(async ({ childId, modifications, effectiveDate }) => {
  const family = await getFamilyContacts(childId)
  await notify({
    to: family,
    message: `Daily schedule updated for ${effectiveDate}: ${modifications.join(', ')}`,
    includeAttachment: 'updated-schedule-pdf'
  })
})
```
