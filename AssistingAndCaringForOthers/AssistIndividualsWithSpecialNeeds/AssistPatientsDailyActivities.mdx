## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { assistPatientsDailyActivities } from '@headlessly/assist-patients-daily-activities'

const care = assistPatientsDailyActivities()

// Create a care plan for a new patient
const plan = await care.createCarePlan({
  patientId: 'PT-2026-2201',
  tasks: ['bathing', 'dressing', 'mealPrep', 'mobility'],
  frequency: 'daily',
  startDate: '2026-02-10'
})

// Log a completed activity
await care.logActivity({
  carePlanId: plan.id,
  task: 'bathing',
  status: 'completed',
  notes: 'Patient required minimal assistance with transfers'
})

// Run a functional assessment
const assessment = await care.assessFunction({
  patientId: 'PT-2026-2201',
  categories: ['bathing', 'dressing', 'eating', 'toileting', 'transferring']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify family when an issue is escalated
care.issueEscalated(async ({ patientId, issue, severity }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'family-contacts',
    message: `Care concern for patient ${patientId}: ${issue}`
  })
})

// Trigger reassessment after repeated task declines
care.taskDeclined(async ({ patientId, task, count }) => {
  if (count >= 3) {
    await care.assessFunction({
      patientId,
      categories: [task],
      reason: 'repeated-decline'
    })
  }
})

// Auto-escalate if session takes too long
care.sessionCompleted(async ({ patientId, duration, scheduledDuration }) => {
  if (duration > scheduledDuration * 1.5) {
    await care.escalateIssue({
      patientId,
      issue: 'Extended care session may indicate increased assistance needs',
      severity: 'medium'
    })
  }
})
```
