## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { feedPatients } from '@headlessly/feed-patients'

const feeding = feedPatients()

// Verify diet order before meal
const verification = await feeding.verifyDietOrder({
  patientId: 'PT-2026-789',
  mealType: 'Lunch',
  dietOrder: 'Mechanical soft, thin liquids, low sodium',
  mealTray: {
    items: ['Chopped chicken', 'Mashed potatoes', 'Soft vegetables', 'Pudding'],
    consistency: 'Mechanical soft',
    restrictions: 'No added salt'
  },
  matches: true
})

// Position patient safely for eating
await feeding.positionPatient({
  patientId: 'PT-2026-789',
  position: 'Head of bed elevated 90 degrees',
  supportProvided: 'Pillow behind back for stability',
  aspirationRisk: 'Moderate - requires upright position and small bites'
})

// Assist with feeding
await feeding.assistWithFeeding({
  patientId: 'PT-2026-789',
  mealType: 'Lunch',
  startTime: '12:15',
  technique: 'Verbal cues for each bite, patient self-feeds with setup',
  biteSize: 'Small amounts on spoon',
  pace: 'Slow - allow time to chew and swallow between bites',
  fluidOffered: 'Water with each few bites',
  patientResponse: 'Cooperative, no coughing or distress noted'
})

// Document intake
await feeding.documentIntake({
  patientId: 'PT-2026-789',
  mealType: 'Lunch',
  percentageEaten: 75,
  fluidsConsumed: 180, // ml
  items: {
    protein: 'Ate most chicken',
    carbs: 'Finished mashed potatoes',
    vegetables: 'Ate half of vegetables',
    dessert: 'Finished pudding'
  },
  duration: 25, // minutes
  concerns: 'None - ate well, no swallowing difficulties'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on poor intake requiring intervention
feeding.intakeDocumented(async ({ patientId, percentageEaten, mealsBelow50Percent }) => {
  if (percentageEaten < 50 && mealsBelow50Percent >= 3) {
    await feeding.reportConcerns({
      patientId,
      concern: 'Inadequate intake for 3+ meals',
      recommendation: 'Dietitian consult for supplements or alternative nutrition'
    })
  }
})

// Monitor swallowing safety
feeding.swallowingMonitored(async ({ patientId, signs }) => {
  if (signs.includes('coughing') || signs.includes('choking')) {
    await notify({
      to: 'registered-nurse',
      priority: 'urgent',
      message: `Swallowing difficulty noted for ${patientId} - speech therapy consult may be needed`
    })
  }
})
```
