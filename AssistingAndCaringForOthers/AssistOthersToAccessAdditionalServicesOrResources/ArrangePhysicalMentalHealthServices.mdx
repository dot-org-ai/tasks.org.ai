```typescript
import { arrangePhysicalMentalHealthServices } from '@headlessly/arrange-physical-mental-health-services'

const healthServices = arrangePhysicalMentalHealthServices()

// Assess a client's health service needs
const assessment = await healthServices.assessNeeds({
  clientId: 'client-456',
  concerns: ['chronic-pain', 'anxiety'],
  urgency: 'moderate'
})

// Find appropriate providers
const providers = await healthServices.findProviders({
  specialties: ['pain-management', 'mental-health'],
  location: { zip: '94103', radius: 10 },
  insuranceAccepted: ['Medicare', 'Blue-Cross']
})

// Submit referral and request authorization

healthServices.authorizationApproved(async ({ referralId, providerId }) => {
  await healthServices.scheduleAppointment({
    referralId,

    preferredDates: getNextThreeWeeks()
  })

// Alert case manager if referral is not completed
healthServices.referralSubmitted(async ({ referralId, clientId }) => {
  setTimeout(async () => {
    const status = await healthServices.trackReferral({ referralId })
    if (status !== 'completed') {
      await notify({
        to: 'case-manager',
        message: `Referral ${referralId} for client ${clientId} pending follow-up`
