## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { helpClientsGetNeededServices } from '@headlessly/help-clients-get-needed-services'

const navigation = helpClientsGetNeededServices()

// Assess client's service needs
const assessment = await navigation.assessNeeds({
  clientId: 'CLT-2026-345',
  currentSituation: {
    housing: 'Homeless - staying in shelter',
    income: 'No current employment or benefits',
    health: 'Uninsured, untreated diabetes',
    food: 'Relies on emergency food assistance'
  },
  identifiedNeeds: [
    'Permanent housing',
    'Healthcare coverage',
    'Chronic disease management',
    'Food assistance',
    'Employment services'
  ],
  urgency: 'High - health condition worsening'
})

// Search for matching resources
const resources = await navigation.searchResources({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  serviceTypes: ['Housing', 'Healthcare', 'Food', 'Employment'],
  location: 'Urban County',
  filters: {
    acceptsUninsured: true,
    providesTransportation: true,
    immediateAvailability: true
  }
})

// Coordinate referral to housing program
await navigation.coordinateReferral({
  clientId: 'CLT-2026-345',
  serviceProviderId: 'PROV-HSG-001',
  programName: 'Rapid Rehousing Initiative',
  referralDate: '2026-02-05',
  contactInfo: 'intake@rapidrehousing.org, 555-0199',
  documentsNeeded: ['Photo ID', 'Proof of homelessness', 'Income statement'],
  appointmentScheduled: '2026-02-12 10:00 AM'
})

// Follow up on service access
await navigation.followUpOnAccess({
  referralId: 'REF-2026-890',
  followUpDate: '2026-02-15',
  contactMethod: 'Phone call with client',
  serviceReceived: false,
  barrier: 'Client unable to attend appointment due to lack of transportation',
  nextSteps: 'Arrange transportation assistance for rescheduled appointment'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-remove barriers when transportation needed
navigation.barriersRemoved(async ({ clientId, barrierType }) => {
  if (barrierType === 'transportation') {
    await navigation.coordinateReferral({
      clientId,
      serviceProviderId: 'PROV-TRANS-001',
      programName: 'Community Transportation Vouchers',
      priority: 'urgent'
    })
  }
})

// Alert on unsuccessful referral attempts
navigation.accessFollowedUp(async ({ clientId, referralId, attempts, serviceReceived }) => {
  if (attempts >= 3 && !serviceReceived) {
    await notify({
      to: 'case-manager-supervisor',
      message: `Client ${clientId} - referral ${referralId} unsuccessful after ${attempts} attempts. May need escalation.`
    })
  }
})
```
