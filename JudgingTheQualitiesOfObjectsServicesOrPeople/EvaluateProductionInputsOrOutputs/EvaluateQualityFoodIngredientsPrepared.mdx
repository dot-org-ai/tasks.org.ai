# Evaluate Quality Food Ingredients Prepared

> Business-as-Code definition for assessing food quality standards. Models the inspection process for raw ingredients and finished food products to ensure safety, freshness, and compliance.

## Overview

Food quality evaluation involves inspecting raw ingredients and prepared foods for freshness, safety, appearance, and compliance with standards. This definition exposes actions for conducting sensory assessments, testing for contamination, verifying temperatures, and documenting quality findings to support food safety and customer satisfaction.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { evaluateQualityFoodIngredientsPrepared } from '@headlessly/evaluate-quality-food-ingredients-prepared'

const food = evaluateQualityFoodIngredientsPrepared()

// Inspect incoming ingredient freshness
const inspection = await food.inspectIngredientFreshness({
  ingredientId: 'ING-5423',
  name: 'organic-spinach',
  deliveryDate: '2026-02-05',
  expirationDate: '2026-02-12',
  visualCondition: 'bright-green-no-wilting',
  freshnessRating: 5
})

// Conduct sensory evaluation
const sensory = await food.conductSensoryEvaluation({
  productId: 'DISH-8821',
  dishName: 'grilled-salmon-with-vegetables',
  criteria: {
    appearance: 4.5,
    aroma: 4.8,
    taste: 4.7,
    texture: 4.6
  },
  overallScore: 4.65
})

// Test food safety
const safety = await food.testFoodSafety({
  sampleId: 'SAMPLE-2026-045',
  productId: 'ING-5423',
  tests: ['salmonella', 'e-coli', 'listeria'],
  results: { salmonella: 'negative', eColi: 'negative', listeria: 'negative' },
  approved: true
})

// Verify temperature compliance
const temp = await food.verifyTemperatureCompliance({
  locationId: 'cooler-3',
  requiredTempMax: 40,
  actualTemp: 38,
  compliant: true
})

// Approve or reject ingredient
const decision = await food.approveRejectIngredient({
  ingredientId: 'ING-5423',
  decision: 'approve',
  rationale: 'Excellent freshness, passed safety tests, proper temperature'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-reject ingredients failing safety tests
food.foodSafetyTested(async ({ productId, results, approved }) => {
  if (!approved) {
    await food.approveRejectIngredient({
      ingredientId: productId,
      decision: 'reject',
      rationale: `Failed safety test: ${Object.keys(results).filter(k => results[k] !== 'negative').join(', ')}`
    })
  }
})

// Alert on temperature non-compliance
food.temperatureComplianceVerified(async ({ locationId, actualTemp, requiredTempMax, compliant }) => {
  if (!compliant) {
    await notify({
      to: 'food-safety-manager',
      priority: 'urgent',
      message: `Temperature violation in ${locationId}: ${actualTemp}°F exceeds ${requiredTempMax}°F`
    })
  }
})

// Flag low sensory scores
food.sensoryEvaluationConducted(async ({ productId, overallScore }) => {
  if (overallScore < 3.5) {
    await notify({
      to: 'executive-chef',
      message: `Product ${productId} received low sensory score: ${overallScore}`
    })
  }
})
```
