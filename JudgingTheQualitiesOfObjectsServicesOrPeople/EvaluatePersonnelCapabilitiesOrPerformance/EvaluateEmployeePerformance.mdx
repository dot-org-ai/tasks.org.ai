## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { evaluateEmployeePerformance } from '@headlessly/evaluate-employee-performance'

const performance = evaluateEmployeePerformance()

// Set objectives for review period
const objectives = await performance.setPerformanceObjectives({
  employeeId: 'EMP-5432',
  period: { start: '2026-01-01', end: '2026-06-30' },
  objectives: [
    { description: 'Complete product launch', weight: 0.4 },
    { description: 'Improve team collaboration', weight: 0.3 },
    { description: 'Develop technical skills', weight: 0.3 }
  ]
})

// Gather 360-degree feedback
const feedback = await performance.gatherPerformanceFeedback({
  employeeId: 'EMP-5432',
  sources: ['manager', 'peers', 'direct-reports'],
  anonymize: true
})

// Analyze metrics and assign rating
const metrics = await performance.analyzePerformanceMetrics({
  employeeId: 'EMP-5432',
  metricTypes: ['project-completion', 'quality-score', 'collaboration-index']
})

const rating = await performance.assignPerformanceRating({
  employeeId: 'EMP-5432',
  overallRating: 4,
  ratingScale: '1-5',
  rationale: 'Exceeded expectations on product launch, strong peer feedback'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-schedule review meetings when feedback complete
performance.performanceFeedbackGathered(async ({ employeeId, feedbackCount }) => {
  if (feedbackCount >= 5) {
    await performance.conductReviewMeeting({
      employeeId,
      scheduledDate: getNextAvailableSlot(employeeId)
    })
  }
})

// Trigger calibration when all ratings assigned
performance.performanceRatingAssigned(async ({ teamId, ratingCount, totalEmployees }) => {
  if (ratingCount === totalEmployees) {
    await performance.calibrateRatingsAcrossTeam({
      teamId,
      targetDistribution: { exceptional: 0.15, exceeds: 0.25, meets: 0.5, needs: 0.1 }
    })
  }
})
```
