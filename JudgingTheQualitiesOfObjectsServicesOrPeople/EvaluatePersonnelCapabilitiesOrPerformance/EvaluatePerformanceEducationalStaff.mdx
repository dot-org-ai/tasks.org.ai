## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { evaluatePerformanceEducationalStaff } from '@headlessly/evaluate-performance-educational-staff'

const education = evaluatePerformanceEducationalStaff()

// Conduct classroom observation
const observation = await education.conductClassroomObservation({
  teacherId: 'TCH-5621',
  date: '2026-02-15',
  lessonTopic: 'Algebra: Solving Linear Equations',
  rubricAreas: ['content-knowledge', 'student-engagement', 'classroom-management'],
  overallScore: 4.2
})

// Gather student feedback
const feedback = await education.gatherStudentFeedback({
  teacherId: 'TCH-5621',
  semester: 'spring-2026',
  courseIds: ['MATH-101', 'MATH-102'],
  responseRate: 0.87
})

// Analyze academic outcomes
const outcomes = await education.analyzeAcademicOutcomes({
  teacherId: 'TCH-5621',
  metrics: ['test-scores', 'pass-rate', 'grade-distribution'],
  comparisonGroup: 'department-average'
})

// Document performance and recommend tenure
const review = await education.documentTeachingPerformance({
  teacherId: 'TCH-5621',
  reviewPeriod: 'academic-year-2025-2026',
  overallRating: 'exceeds-expectations',
  strengths: ['student-engagement', 'innovative-teaching-methods'],
  areasForGrowth: ['integration-of-technology']
})

const tenure = await education.recommendTenurePromotion({
  teacherId: 'TCH-5621',
  decision: 'recommend-tenure',
  rationale: 'Consistently strong teaching evaluations, significant curriculum contributions'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Flag low student feedback scores
education.studentFeedbackGathered(async ({ teacherId, averageRating }) => {
  if (averageRating < 3.0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'department-chair',
      message: `Teacher ${teacherId} received low student ratings (${averageRating}), may need support`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-schedule follow-up observation for improvement areas
education.classroomObservationConducted(async ({ teacherId, areasForImprovement }) => {
  if (areasForImprovement.length > 2) {
    await education.conductClassroomObservation({
      teacherId,
      scheduledDate: getDatePlusWeeks(6),
      focusAreas: areasForImprovement
    })
  }
})
```
