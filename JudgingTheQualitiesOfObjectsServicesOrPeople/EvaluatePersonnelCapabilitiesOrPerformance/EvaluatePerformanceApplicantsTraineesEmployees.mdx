## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { evaluatePerformanceApplicantsTraineesEmployees } from '@headlessly/evaluate-performance-applicants-trainees-employees'

const talent = evaluatePerformanceApplicantsTraineesEmployees()

// Screen job applicant
const screening = await talent.screenApplicant({
  applicantId: 'APP-9823',
  position: 'software-engineer',
  criteria: ['education', 'experience', 'technical-skills']
})

// Monitor trainee progress
const progress = await talent.monitorTraineeProgress({
  traineeId: 'TRN-4521',
  program: 'sales-onboarding',
  milestone: 'product-knowledge-test',
  score: 92
})

// Review employee performance
const review = await talent.reviewEmployeePerformance({
  employeeId: 'EMP-7234',
  period: 'annual',
  rating: 4,
  competencies: [
    { name: 'technical-skills', score: 5 },
    { name: 'collaboration', score: 4 },
    { name: 'leadership', score: 3 }
  ]
})

// Assess retention risk
const risk = await talent.assessRetentionRisk({
  employeeId: 'EMP-7234',
  factors: ['compensation', 'engagement', 'career-growth']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-advance candidates who pass screening
talent.applicantScreened(async ({ applicantId, score }) => {
  if (score >= 80) {
    await talent.conductInterviewAssessment({
      applicantId,
      interviewType: 'technical',
      scheduledDate: getNextInterviewSlot()
    })
  }
})

// Flag trainees struggling with program
talent.traineeProgressMonitored(async ({ traineeId, score }) => {
  if (score < 70) {
    await notify({
      to: 'training-coordinator',
      message: `Trainee ${traineeId} scored ${score} on milestone, may need additional support`
    })
  }
})

// Alert on high retention risk
talent.retentionRiskAssessed(async ({ employeeId, riskLevel }) => {
  if (riskLevel === 'high') {
    await notify({
      to: 'hr-manager',
      message: `Employee ${employeeId} has high turnover risk, recommend retention intervention`
    })
  }
})
```
