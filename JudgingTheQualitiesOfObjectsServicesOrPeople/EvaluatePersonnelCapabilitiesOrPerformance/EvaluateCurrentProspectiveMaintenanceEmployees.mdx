## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { evaluateCurrentProspectiveMaintenanceEmployees } from '@headlessly/evaluate-current-prospective-maintenance-employees'

const maintenance = evaluateCurrentProspectiveMaintenanceEmployees()

// Conduct practical test for candidate
const test = await maintenance.conductPracticalTest({
  candidateId: 'CAND-7823',
  testType: 'hvac-repair',
  equipment: 'commercial-chiller',
  duration: 120
})

// Verify certifications
const certs = await maintenance.verifyCertifications({
  candidateId: 'CAND-7823',
  requiredCertifications: ['EPA-608-Universal', 'OSHA-10']
})

// Review performance history for current employee
const history = await maintenance.reviewPerformanceHistory({
  employeeId: 'TECH-2341',
  period: 'last-12-months',
  metrics: ['work-order-completion', 'quality-score', 'safety-incidents']
})

// Make hiring recommendation
const recommendation = await maintenance.recommendHiring({
  candidateId: 'CAND-7823',
  decision: 'hire',
  rationale: 'Strong technical skills, all certifications current, passed practical test',
  startDate: '2026-03-15'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-reject candidates with expired certifications
maintenance.certificationsVerified(async ({ candidateId, certifications }) => {
  const expired = certifications.filter(c => c.status === 'expired')
  if (expired.length > 0) {
    await maintenance.recommendHiring({
      candidateId,
      decision: 'reject',
      rationale: `Expired certifications: ${expired.map(c => c.name).join(', ')}`
    })
  }
})

// Flag safety compliance issues
maintenance.safetyComplianceAssessed(async ({ employeeId, violations }) => {
  if (violations.length > 2) {
    await notify({
      to: 'safety-manager',
      message: `Employee ${employeeId} has ${violations.length} safety violations`
    })
  }
})
```
