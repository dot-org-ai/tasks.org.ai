## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { evaluateSkillsAthletesPerformers } from '@headlessly/evaluate-skills-athletes-performers'

const talent = evaluateSkillsAthletesPerformers()

// Conduct athletic tryout
const tryout = await talent.conductTryout({
  athleteId: 'ATH-8923',
  sport: 'basketball',
  position: 'point-guard',
  drills: ['shooting', 'ball-handling', 'defense', 'court-vision'],
  date: '2026-02-20'
})

// Assess physical capabilities
const physical = await talent.assessPhysicalCapabilities({
  athleteId: 'ATH-8923',
  measurements: {
    speed: { fortyYardDash: 4.6 },
    verticalJump: 32,
    benchPress: 185,
    bodyFat: 8.2
  }
})

// Analyze performance recording
const recording = await talent.analyzePerformanceRecording({
  performerId: 'PERF-4521',
  recordingType: 'audition-video',
  piece: 'Hamlet Soliloquy',
  criteria: ['vocal-projection', 'emotional-range', 'character-interpretation'],
  overallScore: 4.5
})

// Rank talent and recommend selection
const ranking = await talent.rankTalentLevel({
  candidateId: 'ATH-8923',
  peerGroup: 'division-1-point-guards',
  percentile: 87
})

const selection = await talent.recommendSelection({
  candidateId: 'ATH-8923',
  decision: 'select',
  rationale: 'Strong physical tools, excellent ball-handling, high basketball IQ'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-flag injury concerns
talent.physicalCapabilitiesAssessed(async ({ athleteId, injuryHistory }) => {
  if (injuryHistory.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'sports-medicine',
      message: `Athlete ${athleteId} has injury history: ${injuryHistory.map(i => i.type).join(', ')}`
    })
  }
})

// Advance top performers to next round
talent.talentLevelRanked(async ({ candidateId, percentile }) => {
  if (percentile >= 90) {
    await talent.conductTryout({
      candidateId,
      round: 'final-callback',
      scheduledDate: getNextCallbackDate()
    })
  }
})
```
