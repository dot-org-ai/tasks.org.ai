## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { assessIndividualCommunityNeedsEducational } from '@headlessly/assess-individual-community-needs-educational'

const needs = assessIndividualCommunityNeedsEducational()

// Conduct intake for a community needs assessment
const intake = await needs.conductIntake({
  community: 'Eastside Neighborhood',
  population: 'Families with school-age children',
  contactPerson: 'Maria Gonzalez, Community Center Director',
  initialConcerns: ['after-school tutoring', 'ESL classes', 'youth mentoring']
})

// Administer a needs survey
await needs.administerSurvey({
  intakeId: intake.id,
  surveyType: 'community-education',
  distributionMethod: 'door-to-door and online',
  targetResponses: 200,
  languages: ['English', 'Spanish']
})

// Identify service gaps and develop a plan
const gaps = await needs.identifyServiceGaps({
  intakeId: intake.id,
  assessedNeeds: ['ESL instruction', 'after-school care', 'parent education workshops'],
  existingServices: ['one ESL class at community college, waitlisted']
})

await needs.developServicePlan({
  intakeId: intake.id,
  gaps: gaps.id,
  plan: [
    { need: 'ESL instruction', action: 'Partner with library for evening ESL classes', timeline: 'Q2 2026' },
    { need: 'After-school care', action: 'Expand community center hours with volunteer tutors', timeline: 'Q3 2026' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify funding bodies when critical service gaps are identified
needs.serviceGapsIdentified(async ({ intakeId, gaps }) => {
  const critical = gaps.filter(g => g.severity === 'critical')
  if (critical.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'funding-coordinator',
      message: `${critical.length} critical service gaps identified in assessment #${intakeId}. Grant applications recommended.`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-generate referral packets when resources are recommended
needs.resourcesRecommended(async ({ intakeId, resources }) => {
  for (const resource of resources) {
    await generateReferralPacket({ intakeId, program: resource.name, contact: resource.contactInfo })
  }
})
```
