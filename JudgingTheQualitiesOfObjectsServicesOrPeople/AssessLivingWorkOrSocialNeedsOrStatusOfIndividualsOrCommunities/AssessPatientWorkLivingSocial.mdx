## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { assessPatientWorkLivingSocial } from '@headlessly/assess-patient-work-living-social'

const envAssess = assessPatientWorkLivingSocial()

// Initiate an assessment for a patient recovering from hip replacement
const assessment = await envAssess.initiateAssessment({
  patientId: 'PT-88421',
  reason: 'Post-surgical discharge planning - hip replacement',
  assessmentTypes: ['living', 'social']
})

// Evaluate living conditions
await envAssess.evaluateLivingConditions({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  findings: {
    stairAccess: true,
    bathroomGrabBars: false,
    trippingHazards: ['loose rugs in hallway', 'cluttered bedroom floor'],
    wheelchairAccessible: false
  }
})

// Identify risk factors and generate recommendations
await envAssess.identifyRiskFactors({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  risks: [
    { factor: 'No bathroom grab bars', severity: 'high', area: 'fall prevention' },
    { factor: 'Stairs to bedroom', severity: 'medium', area: 'mobility' }
  ]
})

await envAssess.generateRecommendations({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  recommendations: [
    { action: 'Install grab bars in bathroom', priority: 'high' },
    { action: 'Arrange temporary bedroom on ground floor', priority: 'high' },
    { action: 'Remove loose rugs', priority: 'medium' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert case manager when high-severity risks are identified
envAssess.riskFactorsIdentified(async ({ assessmentId, risks }) => {
  const highRisks = risks.filter(r => r.severity === 'high')
  if (highRisks.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'case-manager',
      message: `${highRisks.length} high-severity environmental risks identified for assessment #${assessmentId}`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-generate referrals when recommendations include community services
envAssess.recommendationsGenerated(async ({ assessmentId, recommendations }) => {
  const serviceReferrals = recommendations.filter(r => r.requiresExternalService)
  for (const referral of serviceReferrals) {
    await createReferral({ assessmentId, service: referral.action })
  }
})
```
