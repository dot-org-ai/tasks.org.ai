## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { evaluateCharacteristicsIndividualsDetermineNeeds } from '@headlessly/evaluate-characteristics-individuals-determine-needs'

const evaluator = evaluateCharacteristicsIndividualsDetermineNeeds()

// Begin new assessment
const assessment = await evaluator.initiateAssessment({
  applicantId: 'APP-2847',
  programType: 'housing-assistance',
  requestDate: '2026-02-05'
})

// Collect individual characteristics
await evaluator.collectCharacteristics({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  characteristics: {
    householdSize: 3,
    monthlyIncome: 2400,
    employmentStatus: 'employed',
    disabilityStatus: 'none',
    housingStatus: 'rent-burdened'
  }
})

// Determine eligibility and needs
const determination = await evaluator.applyEligibilityCriteria({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  program: 'section-8-voucher'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-request verification when needed
evaluator.characteristicsCollected(async ({ assessmentId, characteristics }) => {
  if (characteristics.monthlyIncome > 1000) {
    await evaluator.verifyInformation({
      assessmentId,
      verificationType: 'income',
      provider: 'employment-agency'
    })
  }
})

// Generate service plan after determination
evaluator.needsDetermined(async ({ assessmentId, needs }) => {
  await evaluator.generateServicePlan({
    assessmentId,
    services: needs.map(need => ({
      type: need.category,
      urgency: need.priority
    }))
  })
})
```
