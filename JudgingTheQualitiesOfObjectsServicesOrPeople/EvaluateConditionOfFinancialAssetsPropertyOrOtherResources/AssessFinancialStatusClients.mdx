// Begin financial assessment
const assessment = await assessor.initiateAssessment({
  clientId: 'CLI-7392',
  assessmentType: 'mortgage-application',
  loanAmount: 450000,
  purpose: 'home-purchase'
})

// Collect and verify financial data

const capacity = await assessor.evaluateCapacity({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  proposedPayment: 2800
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-pull credit report after data collection
assessor.financialDataCollected(async ({ assessmentId, clientId }) => {
  await assessor.analyzeCreditHistory({
    assessmentId,
    bureaus: ['Experian', 'Equifax', 'TransUnion'],
    clientConsent: true
  })
})

// Flag high debt-to-income ratios
assessor.debtRatiosCalculated(async ({ assessmentId, ratios }) => {
  if (ratios.debtToIncome > 43) {
    await notifyUnderwriter({
      assessmentId,
      alert: 'high-dti',
      ratio: ratios.debtToIncome,
      recommendation: 'additional-review-required'
    })
  }
})

// Auto-assign risk rating after capacity evaluation
assessor.capacityEvaluated(async ({ assessmentId, capacity }) => {
  const riskFactors = {
    creditScore: capacity.creditScore,
    debtToIncome: capacity.debtToIncome,
    reserves: capacity.monthsReserves
  }
  await assessor.assignRiskRating({
