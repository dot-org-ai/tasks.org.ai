## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { appraisePropertyValues } from '@headlessly/appraise-property-values'

const appraisal = appraisePropertyValues()

// Accept new appraisal assignment
const order = await appraisal.acceptAssignment({
  propertyAddress: '742 Maple Drive, Springfield',
  propertyType: 'single-family-residential',
  requestedBy: 'First National Bank',
  loanAmount: 425000,
  dueDate: '2026-02-15'
})

// Conduct property inspection
const inspection = await appraisal.inspectProperty({
  orderId: order.id,
  inspectionDate: '2026-02-08',
  observations: {
    squareFeet: 2400,
    bedrooms: 4,
    bathrooms: 2.5,
    condition: 'good',
    upgrades: ['kitchen-remodel-2024', 'new-roof-2023']
  }
})

// Research and apply valuation
const comparables = await appraisal.researchComparables({
  orderId: order.id,
  radius: 1.0,
  timeframe: 'last-6-months',
  minCount: 3
})

const value = await appraisal.determineValue({
  orderId: order.id,
  approach: 'sales-comparison'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-schedule inspection after assignment
appraisal.assignmentAccepted(async ({ orderId, propertyAddress }) => {
  await appraisal.inspectProperty({
    orderId,
    scheduledDate: addBusinessDays(new Date(), 3),
    notifyOwner: true
  })
})

// Alert on value discrepancies
appraisal.valueDetermined(async ({ orderId, value, loanAmount }) => {
  const loanToValue = (loanAmount / value.amount) * 100
  if (loanToValue > 80) {
    await notifyUnderwriter({
      orderId,
      alert: 'high-ltv',
      loanToValue,
      recommendation: 'review-required'
    })
  }
})

// Auto-submit for review
appraisal.reportPrepared(async ({ orderId, appraiserId }) => {
  await submitForReview({
    orderId,
    reviewType: 'quality-control',
    assignTo: 'review-queue'
  })
})
```
