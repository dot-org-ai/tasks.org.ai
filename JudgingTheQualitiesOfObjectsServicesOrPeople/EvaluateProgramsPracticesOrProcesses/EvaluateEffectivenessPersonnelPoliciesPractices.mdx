## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { evaluateEffectivenessPersonnelPoliciesPractices } from '@headlessly/evaluate-effectiveness-personnel-policies-practices'

const policies = evaluateEffectivenessPersonnelPoliciesPractices()

// Assess compliance across organization
const compliance = await policies.assessCompliance({
  policyIds: ['remote-work-2024', 'pto-accrual', 'performance-review'],
  period: { start: '2025-01-01', end: '2025-12-31' },
  units: ['engineering', 'sales', 'operations']
})

// Collect employee feedback
await policies.collectFeedback({
  surveyType: 'policy-satisfaction',
  policyIds: ['remote-work-2024'],
  targetPopulation: 'all-employees'
})

// Analyze impact on retention
const impact = await policies.analyzeImpact({
  policyId: 'remote-work-2024',
  metrics: ['turnover-rate', 'satisfaction-score', 'productivity-index'],
  comparisonPeriod: 'pre-policy'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on compliance issues
policies.risksIdentified(async ({ policyId, risks }) => {
  const criticalRisks = risks.filter(r => r.severity === 'high')
  if (criticalRisks.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'compliance-officer',
      message: `High-severity risks found in ${policyId}: ${criticalRisks.map(r => r.description).join(', ')}`
    })
  }
})

// Automatically track outcomes after changes
policies.changesRecommended(async ({ policyId, changes }) => {
  await scheduleTask({
    action: 'trackOutcomes',
    policyId,
    startDate: addMonths(new Date(), 3),
    frequency: 'quarterly'
  })
})
```
