## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { evaluateEffectivenessCounselingEducationalPrograms } from '@headlessly/evaluate-effectiveness-counseling-educational-programs'

const programs = evaluateEffectivenessCounselingEducationalPrograms()

// Define objectives for college readiness program
const objectives = await programs.defineProgramObjectives({
  programId: 'PROG-COLLEGE-READY-2026',
  programName: 'College Readiness Initiative',
  targetPopulation: 'high-school-juniors-seniors',
  goals: [
    { metric: 'college-application-completion', target: 0.95 },
    { metric: 'fafsa-submission-rate', target: 0.90 },
    { metric: 'college-acceptance-rate', target: 0.85 }
  ]
})

// Collect participant baseline data
const participants = await programs.collectParticipantData({
  programId: 'PROG-COLLEGE-READY-2026',
  cohortSize: 240,
  demographics: {
    firstGeneration: 0.68,
    freeReducedLunch: 0.72,
    underrepresentedMinority: 0.58
  },
  baselineGPA: 2.84
})

// Measure student outcomes
const outcomes = await programs.measureStudentOutcomes({
  programId: 'PROG-COLLEGE-READY-2026',
  results: {
    applicationCompletionRate: 0.96,
    fafsaSubmissionRate: 0.91,
    collegeAcceptanceRate: 0.88,
    averageScholarshipAmount: 12500
  }
})

// Gather participant feedback
const feedback = await programs.gatherParticipantFeedback({
  programId: 'PROG-COLLEGE-READY-2026',
  surveyResponseRate: 0.83,
  satisfactionRating: 4.6,
  themes: ['helpful-counseling', 'application-support', 'financial-aid-guidance']
})

// Generate effectiveness report
const report = await programs.generateEffectivenessReport({
  programId: 'PROG-COLLEGE-READY-2026',
  findings: 'Program exceeded all target goals, strong participant satisfaction, significant impact on first-generation students',
  recommendations: ['Expand to additional high schools', 'Increase financial aid workshop frequency', 'Add peer mentoring component']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert when outcomes fall short of goals
programs.studentOutcomesMeasured(async ({ programId, results, goals }) => {
  const missedGoals = goals.filter(g => results[g.metric] < g.target)
  if (missedGoals.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'program-director',
      message: `Program ${programId} missed ${missedGoals.length} outcome targets, recommend program review`
    })
  }
})

// Flag low attendance programs
programs.attendanceEngagementAnalyzed(async ({ programId, attendanceRate }) => {
  if (attendanceRate < 0.70) {
    await notify({
      to: 'program-team',
      message: `Program ${programId} has low attendance (${attendanceRate * 100}%), investigate engagement barriers`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-publish successful program evaluations
programs.effectivenessReportGenerated(async ({ programId, findings, results }) => {
  const allGoalsMet = Object.values(results).every((v, i) => v >= objectives.goals[i].target)
  if (allGoalsMet) {
    await publishReport({
      programId,
      report: findings,
      audience: 'stakeholders-and-funders'
    })
  }
})
```
