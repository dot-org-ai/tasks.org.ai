## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { measureEffectivenessBusinessStrategiesPractices } from '@headlessly/measure-effectiveness-business-strategies-practices'

const strategy = measureEffectivenessBusinessStrategiesPractices()

// Define KPIs for market expansion strategy
const kpis = await strategy.defineKPIs({
  strategyId: 'apac-expansion-2026',
  objectives: ['revenue-growth', 'market-share', 'customer-acquisition'],
  indicators: [
    { objective: 'revenue-growth', kpi: 'apac-revenue', target: 50000000, unit: 'usd' },
    { objective: 'market-share', kpi: 'market-penetration', target: 0.15, unit: 'percentage' },
    { objective: 'customer-acquisition', kpi: 'new-customers', target: 5000, unit: 'count' }
  ]
})

// Track performance and calculate ROI
await strategy.trackPerformance({
  strategyId: 'apac-expansion-2026',
  period: { start: '2026-01-01', end: '2026-06-30' },
  kpiIds: ['apac-revenue', 'market-penetration', 'new-customers']
})

const roi = await strategy.calculateROI({
  strategyId: 'apac-expansion-2026',
  investment: 10000000,
  returns: { revenue: 25000000, costSavings: 0 },
  timeframe: '6-months'
})

// Benchmark against competitors
await strategy.benchmarkCompetitors({
  strategyId: 'apac-expansion-2026',
  competitors: ['competitor-a', 'competitor-b'],
  metrics: ['market-share', 'revenue-growth']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on significant variance
strategy.varianceAnalyzed(async ({ strategyId, variances }) => {
  const significantGaps = variances.filter(v => Math.abs(v.percentDiff) > 20)
  if (significantGaps.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'chief-strategy-officer',
      message: `Strategy ${strategyId} has ${significantGaps.length} KPIs off target by >20%`
    })
  }
})

// Automatically recommend adjustments for underperforming strategies
strategy.competitorsBenchmarked(async ({ strategyId, comparison }) => {
  const underperforming = comparison.metrics.filter(m => m.rank > 3)
  if (underperforming.length > 0) {
    await strategy.recommendAdjustments({
      strategyId,
      focus: underperforming.map(m => m.name),
      rationale: 'competitive-positioning'
    })
  }
})
```
