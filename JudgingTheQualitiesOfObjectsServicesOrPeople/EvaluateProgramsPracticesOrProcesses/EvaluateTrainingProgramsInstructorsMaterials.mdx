# Evaluate Training Programs Instructors Materials

> Business-as-Code definition for training evaluation. Models the systematic assessment of training effectiveness, instructor performance, and material quality through learner feedback, competency measurement, and continuous improvement.

## Overview

Training program evaluation involves measuring learning outcomes, assessing instructor effectiveness, reviewing material quality, analyzing participant satisfaction, and identifying improvement opportunities. This definition exposes actions for data collection, competency assessment, instructor evaluation, and evidence-based training enhancement across onboarding, compliance, and skill development programs.

## Actors

| Actor | Description |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { evaluateTrainingProgramsInstructorsMaterials } from '@headlessly/evaluate-training-programs-instructors-materials'

const training = evaluateTrainingProgramsInstructorsMaterials()

// Assess learning from a compliance training
const learning = await training.assessLearning({
  programId: 'safety-compliance-2026',
  courseId: 'hazmat-handling',
  trainees: ['emp-1234', 'emp-5678'],
  assessmentType: 'post-test',
  passingScore: 80
})

// Evaluate instructor effectiveness
await training.evaluateInstructor({
  instructorId: 'inst-101',
  courseId: 'hazmat-handling',
  evaluationDate: '2026-06-15',
  participants: ['emp-1234', 'emp-5678'],
  criteria: ['clarity', 'engagement', 'knowledge', 'responsiveness']
})

// Review training materials
const materials = await training.reviewMaterials({
  programId: 'safety-compliance-2026',
  reviewers: ['sme-202', 'id-303'],
  criteria: ['accuracy', 'relevance', 'clarity', 'accessibility']
})

// Measure on-job application
await training.measureApplication({
  programId: 'safety-compliance-2026',
  trainees: ['emp-1234'],
  observationPeriod: '30-days',
  competencies: ['proper-ppe-use', 'spill-response']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on low instructor ratings
training.instructorEvaluated(async ({ instructorId, courseId, ratings }) => {
  const avgRating = ratings.reduce((sum, r) => sum + r.score, 0) / ratings.length
  if (avgRating < 3.5) {
    await notify({
      to: 'training-manager',
      message: `Instructor ${instructorId} rated ${avgRating}/5 in ${courseId}`
    })
  }
})

// Automatically recommend improvements when gaps found
training.gapsIdentified(async ({ programId, gaps }) => {
  const recommendations = gaps.map(gap => ({
    area: gap.area,
    suggestion: generateRecommendation(gap)
  }))
  await training.recommendImprovements({ programId, recommendations })
})
```
