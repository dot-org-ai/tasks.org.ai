## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { evaluateScholarlyMaterials } from '@headlessly/evaluate-scholarly-materials'

const scholarly = evaluateScholarlyMaterials()

// Assess originality of a manuscript
const originality = await scholarly.assessOriginality({
  submissionId: 'jcb-2026-1234',
  title: 'Novel CRISPR-Cas9 Mechanism for Gene Regulation',
  abstract: '...',
  keywords: ['CRISPR', 'gene-regulation', 'epigenetics'],
  comparisonScope: 'last-5-years'
})

// Review methodology
await scholarly.reviewMethodology({
  submissionId: 'jcb-2026-1234',
  researchDesign: 'experimental',
  aspects: ['sample-size', 'controls', 'statistical-methods', 'replicability'],
  rigorLevel: 'high'
})

// Evaluate significance
const significance = await scholarly.evaluateSignificance({
  submissionId: 'jcb-2026-1234',
  dimensions: ['theoretical-contribution', 'practical-application', 'field-advancement'],
  scope: 'field-wide'
})

// Check literature and verify ethics
await scholarly.checkLiterature({
  submissionId: 'jcb-2026-1234',
  criteria: ['completeness', 'currency', 'relevance', 'balance']
})

await scholarly.verifyEthics({
  submissionId: 'jcb-2026-1234',
  aspects: ['irb-approval', 'informed-consent', 'data-privacy', 'conflict-of-interest']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on ethics concerns
scholarly.ethicsVerified(async ({ submissionId, results }) => {
  const concerns = results.filter(r => r.status === 'concern')
  if (concerns.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'ethics-committee',
      message: `Submission ${submissionId} has ethics concerns: ${concerns.map(c => c.issue).join(', ')}`
    })
  }
})

// Automatically make recommendation when all reviews complete
scholarly.clarityReviewed(async ({ submissionId }) => {
  const originality = await scholarly.getScore({ submissionId, criterion: 'originality' })
  const methodology = await scholarly.getScore({ submissionId, criterion: 'methodology' })
  const significance = await scholarly.getScore({ submissionId, criterion: 'significance' })

  const avgScore = (originality + methodology + significance) / 3

  let decision
  if (avgScore >= 4.0) decision = 'accept'
  else if (avgScore >= 3.0) decision = 'revise-resubmit'
  else decision = 'reject'

  await scholarly.makeRecommendation({ submissionId, decision, rationale: `Average score: ${avgScore.toFixed(1)}/5` })
})
```
