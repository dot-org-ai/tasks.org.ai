## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { administerTestsAssessEducationalNeeds } from '@headlessly/administer-tests-assess-educational-needs'

const testing = administerTestsAssessEducationalNeeds()

// Schedule diagnostic reading assessment
const session = await testing.scheduleTest({
  assessmentName: 'Diagnostic Reading Assessment',
  grade: 3,
  students: ['STU-2847', 'STU-2848', 'STU-2849'],
  date: '2026-02-15',
  duration: 45,
  accommodations: [
    { studentId: 'STU-2848', type: 'extended-time', multiplier: 1.5 }
  ]
})

// Conduct the assessment
await testing.conductAssessment({
  sessionId: session.id,
  startTime: '2026-02-15T09:00:00Z',
  protocol: 'standard'
})

// Score and generate report
const scores = await testing.scoreTest({
  sessionId: session.id
})

const report = await testing.generateReport({
  sessionId: session.id,
  includeRecommendations: true
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-notify parents when results are ready
testing.reportGenerated(async ({ sessionId, students, report }) => {
  for (const studentId of students) {
    const parent = await getParentContact(studentId)
    await sendNotification({
      to: parent.email,
      subject: 'Assessment Results Available',
      attachments: [report.url]
    })
  }
})

// Flag students needing intervention
testing.testScored(async ({ sessionId, scores }) => {
  const lowScores = scores.filter(s => s.percentile < 25)
  if (lowScores.length > 0) {
    await createInterventionReferral({
      sessionId,
      students: lowScores.map(s => s.studentId),
      reason: 'below-benchmark-performance'
    })
  }
})
```
