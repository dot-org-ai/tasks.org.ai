## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { evaluateStudentWork } from '@headlessly/evaluate-student-work'

const evaluator = evaluateStudentWork()

// Collect essay submissions
const submissions = await evaluator.collectSubmissions({
  assignmentId: 'ESSAY-301',
  class: 'ENG-101-03',
  dueDate: '2026-02-05T23:59:00Z',
  totalStudents: 24
})

// Apply rubric to evaluate quality
await evaluator.applyRubric({
  submissionId: 'SUB-8472',
  rubricId: 'ESSAY-RUBRIC-v2',
  scores: {
    thesis: 4,
    evidence: 3,
    organization: 4,
    conventions: 3
  }
})

// Calculate final grade and provide feedback
const grade = await evaluator.calculateGrade({
  submissionId: 'SUB-8472'
})

await evaluator.provideFeedback({
  submissionId: 'SUB-8472',
  feedback: 'Strong thesis statement and clear organization. Consider using more varied evidence sources to strengthen your argument.'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-return work when feedback is complete
evaluator.feedbackProvided(async ({ submissionId }) => {
  await evaluator.recordEvaluation({ submissionId })
  await evaluator.returnWork({ submissionId })
})

// Notify students of low grades
evaluator.gradeCalculated(async ({ submissionId, grade, student }) => {
  if (grade.percentage < 70) {
    await sendNotification({
      to: student.email,
      subject: 'Assignment Available for Review',
      message: 'Your graded assignment is ready. Please review the feedback and consider office hours for support.'
    })
  }
})

// Flag class-wide performance issues
evaluator.performanceAnalyzed(async ({ assignmentId, results }) => {
  if (results.averageScore < 75 && results.failureRate > 0.3) {
    await notifyInstructor({
      assignmentId,
      recommendation: 'consider-reteaching',
      data: results
    })
  }
})
```
