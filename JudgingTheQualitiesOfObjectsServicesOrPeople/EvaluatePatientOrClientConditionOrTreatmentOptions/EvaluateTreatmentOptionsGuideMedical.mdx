## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { evaluateTreatmentOptionsGuideMedical } from '@headlessly/evaluate-treatment-options-guide-medical'

const treatment = evaluateTreatmentOptionsGuideMedical()

// Review patient condition
const condition = await treatment.reviewPatientCondition({
  patientId: 'PT-89234',
  diagnosis: 'Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus',
  severity: 'moderate',
  comorbidities: ['hypertension', 'obesity']
})

// Identify available treatment options
const options = await treatment.identifyTreatmentOptions({
  conditionId: condition.id,
  patientAge: 52,
  insurancePlan: 'PPO'
})

// Compare efficacy and recommend treatment
const comparison = await treatment.compareTreatmentEfficacy({
  options: options.map(o => o.id),
  evidenceLevel: 'randomized-controlled-trial'
})

const recommendation = await treatment.recommendTreatment({
  optionId: comparison.topRanked.id,
  rationale: 'Highest efficacy with acceptable side effect profile',
  approvedBy: 'Dr. Johnson'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-flag high-risk treatments
treatment.treatmentRisksAssessed(async ({ optionId, risks }) => {
  const highRisk = risks.filter(r => r.severity === 'severe')
  if (highRisk.length > 0) {
    await treatment.requestSpecialistConsult({
      optionId,
      reason: `High risk complications identified: ${highRisk.map(r => r.name).join(', ')}`
    })
  }
})

// Notify patient when recommendation ready
treatment.treatmentRecommended(async ({ patientId, recommendation }) => {
  await notify({
    to: patientId,
    channel: 'patient-portal',
    message: `Your provider has recommended: ${recommendation.treatmentName}`
  })
})
```
