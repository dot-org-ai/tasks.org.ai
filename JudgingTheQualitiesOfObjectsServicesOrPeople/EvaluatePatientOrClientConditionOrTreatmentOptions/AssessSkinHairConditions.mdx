## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { assessSkinHairConditions } from '@headlessly/assess-skin-hair-conditions'

const assessor = assessSkinHairConditions()

// Begin consultation
const assessment = await assessor.conductConsultation({
  clientId: 'CLI-5829',
  chiefConcern: 'hair-thinning',
  duration: 6,
  durationUnit: 'months',
  previousTreatments: ['over-the-counter-minoxidil']
})

// Perform examination
await assessor.performVisualExamination({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  areas: ['scalp', 'hairline', 'crown'],
  observations: {
    hairDensity: 'reduced',
    scalpCondition: 'normal',
    inflammation: false
  }
})

// Analyze scalp with specialized tools
const scalpAnalysis = await assessor.analyzeScalpCondition({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  method: 'trichoscopy',
  findings: {
    follicleHealth: 'miniaturization-present',
    hairShaftDiameter: 'variable',
    telogenPercentage: 35
  }
})

// Develop treatment plan
const plan = await assessor.developTreatmentPlan({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  diagnosis: 'androgenetic-alopecia',
  interventions: ['prescription-finasteride', 'low-level-light-therapy']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-order tests for suspicious lesions
assessor.visualExaminationPerformed(async ({ assessmentId, observations }) => {
  if (observations.lesions?.some(l => l.characteristics.includes('irregular-border'))) {
    await assessor.orderDiagnosticTests({
      assessmentId,
      tests: ['dermatoscopy', 'biopsy-if-indicated'],
      urgency: 'priority'
    })
  }
})

// Capture progress photos at consultation
assessor.consultationConducted(async ({ assessmentId, chiefConcern }) => {
  if (['hair-loss', 'acne', 'pigmentation'].includes(chiefConcern)) {
    await captureProgressPhotos({
      assessmentId,
      views: ['frontal', 'lateral', 'crown'],
      lighting: 'standardized'
    })
  }
})

// Schedule follow-up based on treatment type
assessor.treatmentPlanDeveloped(async ({ assessmentId, interventions }) => {
  const followUpWeeks = interventions.some(i => i.includes('prescription')) ? 8 : 12
  await assessor.scheduleFollowUp({
    assessmentId,
    weeksFromNow: followUpWeeks,
    purpose: 'treatment-response-evaluation'
  })
})
```
