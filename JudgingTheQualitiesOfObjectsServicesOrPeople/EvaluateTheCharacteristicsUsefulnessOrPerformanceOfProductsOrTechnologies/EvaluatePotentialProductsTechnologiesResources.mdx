## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { evaluatePotentialProductsTechnologiesResources } from '@headlessly/evaluate-potential-products-technologies-resources'

const evaluator = evaluatePotentialProductsTechnologiesResources()

// Identify new product opportunity
const opportunity = await evaluator.identifyOpportunity({
  type: 'product',
  name: 'Smart Factory Energy Optimization Platform',
  category: 'Industrial IoT',
  description: 'AI-powered system for real-time energy consumption optimization'
})

// Analyze market potential
const marketAnalysis = await evaluator.analyzeMarketPotential({
  opportunityId: opportunity.id,
  targetMarket: 'Manufacturing facilities 50,000+ sq ft',
  estimatedMarketSize: '12B USD',
  projectedCAGR: 0.18,
  competitiveLandscape: 'moderate'
})

// Assess scalability
const scalability = await evaluator.assessScalability({
  opportunityId: opportunity.id,
  factors: {
    technicalScalability: 'high',
    marketExpansion: ['North America', 'Europe', 'Asia-Pacific'],
    productLineExtensions: ['retail', 'logistics', 'data centers'],
    resourceRequirements: 'moderate'
  }
})

// Project financial returns
const financials = await evaluator.projectFinancialReturns({
  opportunityId: opportunity.id,
  timeHorizon: '5 years',
  developmentCost: 3500000,
  projectedRevenue: { year1: 1000000, year3: 8000000, year5: 22000000 },
  projectedMargin: 0.65
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-create development plan for high-potential opportunities
evaluator.investmentRecommended(async ({ opportunityId, recommendation }) => {
  if (recommendation.priority === 'high') {
    await createProject({
      type: 'ProductDevelopment',
      opportunityId,
      phases: ['research', 'prototype', 'pilot', 'launch'],
      budget: recommendation.requestedBudget
    })
  }
})

// Alert executives on strategic fit assessments
evaluator.strategicFitDetermined(async ({ opportunityId, fit }) => {
  if (fit.alignmentScore > 0.8) {
    await notify({
      to: 'executive-committee',
      priority: 'high',
      subject: `High-Value Opportunity Identified: ${fit.opportunityName}`,
      body: `Strategic alignment score: ${fit.alignmentScore * 100}%`
    })
  }
})
```
