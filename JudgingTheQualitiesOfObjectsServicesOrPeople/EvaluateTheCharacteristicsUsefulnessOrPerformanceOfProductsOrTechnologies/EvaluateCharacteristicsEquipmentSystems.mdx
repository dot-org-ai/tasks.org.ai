# Evaluate Characteristics Equipment Systems

> Business-as-Code definition for equipment and system evaluation. Models the comprehensive assessment of technical specifications, operational performance, reliability, and suitability through testing, benchmarking, and criteria-based analysis.

## Overview

Equipment and system characteristics evaluation involves measuring technical specifications, testing operational performance, assessing reliability and maintainability, evaluating compliance with standards, and determining suitability for intended applications. This definition exposes actions for specification verification, performance testing, reliability analysis, and selection recommendation across manufacturing equipment, IT systems, and infrastructure.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { evaluateCharacteristicsEquipmentSystems } from '@headlessly/evaluate-characteristics-equipment-systems'

const equipment = evaluateCharacteristicsEquipmentSystems()

// Verify specifications for CNC machine options
const specs = await equipment.verifySpecifications({
  equipmentCategory: 'cnc-milling-machine',
  options: [
    { vendor: 'vendor-a', model: 'model-x', specs: { workEnvelope: '1000x500x500mm', spindle: '15000rpm', accuracy: '0.005mm' } },
    { vendor: 'vendor-b', model: 'model-y', specs: { workEnvelope: '1200x600x600mm', spindle: '12000rpm', accuracy: '0.008mm' } }
  ],
  requirements: { minWorkEnvelope: '1000x500x500mm', minSpindle: 12000, maxAccuracy: 0.01 }
})

// Test performance
const performance = await equipment.testPerformance({
  equipmentId: 'vendor-a-model-x',
  tests: [
    { type: 'cutting-speed', conditions: { material: 'aluminum', depth: '2mm' } },
    { type: 'surface-finish', conditions: { feedRate: '500mm/min' } },
    { type: 'dimensional-accuracy', conditions: { tolerance: '0.01mm' } }
  ]
})

// Assess reliability
await equipment.assessReliability({
  equipmentId: 'vendor-a-model-x',
  metrics: ['mtbf', 'mttr', 'availability'],
  dataSources: ['vendor-warranty', 'industry-benchmarks', 'customer-reviews']
})

// Check compliance and evaluate suitability
await equipment.checkCompliance({
  equipmentId: 'vendor-a-model-x',
  standards: ['iso-230-2', 'ce-marking', 'osha-safety'],
  certifications: true
})

const suitability = await equipment.evaluateSuitability({
  equipmentId: 'vendor-a-model-x',
  application: 'precision-aerospace-parts',
  criteria: ['accuracy', 'repeatability', 'material-compatibility', 'production-volume']
})

// Compare options
await equipment.compareOptions({
  category: 'cnc-milling-machine',
  optionIds: ['vendor-a-model-x', 'vendor-b-model-y'],
  weights: { performance: 0.4, reliability: 0.3, cost: 0.2, compliance: 0.1 }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on compliance failures
equipment.complianceChecked(async ({ equipmentId, results }) => {
  const failures = results.filter(r => r.status === 'non-compliant')
  if (failures.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'procurement-team',
      message: `Equipment ${equipmentId} fails compliance: ${failures.map(f => f.standard).join(', ')}`
    })
  }
})

// Automatically recommend selection after comparison
equipment.optionsCompared(async ({ category, ranking }) => {
  const topOption = ranking[0]
  if (topOption.score > 80) {
    await equipment.recommendSelection({
      category,
      equipmentId: topOption.equipmentId,
      rationale: `Highest score (${topOption.score}/100) across weighted criteria`
    })
  }
})
```
