# Evaluate Characteristics Green Technologies

> Business-as-Code definition for green technology evaluation. Models the assessment of environmental impact, sustainability performance, resource efficiency, and lifecycle characteristics of eco-friendly technologies through emissions analysis, certification verification, and comparative benchmarking.

## Overview

Green technology characteristics evaluation involves measuring environmental impact reduction, assessing resource efficiency, verifying sustainability certifications, analyzing lifecycle emissions, and comparing alternatives to determine optimal environmental outcomes. This definition exposes actions for emissions calculation, efficiency measurement, certification validation, and sustainability scoring across renewable energy, waste reduction, and clean production technologies.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { evaluateCharacteristicsGreenTechnologies } from '@headlessly/evaluate-characteristics-green-technologies'

const greenTech = evaluateCharacteristicsGreenTechnologies()

// Calculate emissions for solar panel options
const emissions = await greenTech.calculateEmissions({
  technologyCategory: 'solar-pv',
  options: [
    { vendor: 'vendor-a', model: 'monocrystalline-400w', scope: 'manufacturing-operation-disposal' },
    { vendor: 'vendor-b', model: 'polycrystalline-380w', scope: 'manufacturing-operation-disposal' }
  ],
  lifetime: '25-years',
  location: 'california'
})

// Assess efficiency
await greenTech.assessEfficiency({
  technologyId: 'vendor-a-monocrystalline',
  metrics: ['energy-conversion', 'land-use', 'water-consumption', 'material-efficiency'],
  benchmarkType: 'industry-average'
})

// Verify certifications
const certifications = await greenTech.verifyCertifications({
  technologyId: 'vendor-a-monocrystalline',
  claims: ['energy-star', 'cradle-to-cradle', 'carbon-neutral', 'iso-14001'],
  verificationLevel: 'third-party'
})

// Analyze lifecycle and measure impact reduction
await greenTech.analyzeLifecycle({
  technologyId: 'vendor-a-monocrystalline',
  phases: ['raw-material-extraction', 'manufacturing', 'transportation', 'operation', 'disposal'],
  impactCategories: ['carbon-footprint', 'water-usage', 'toxicity', 'resource-depletion']
})

const impactReduction = await greenTech.measureImpactReduction({
  technologyId: 'vendor-a-monocrystalline',
  baseline: 'coal-power-generation',
  metrics: ['co2-avoided', 'water-saved', 'pollution-reduced'],
  period: '25-years'
})

// Compare technologies and score sustainability
await greenTech.compareTechnologies({
  category: 'solar-pv',
  optionIds: ['vendor-a-monocrystalline', 'vendor-b-polycrystalline'],
  weights: { emissions: 0.35, efficiency: 0.30, lifecycle: 0.25, cost: 0.10 }
})

const score = await greenTech.scoreSustainability({
  technologyId: 'vendor-a-monocrystalline',
  framework: 'leed-v4.1',
  includeBreakdown: true
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on certification failures
greenTech.certificationsVerified(async ({ technologyId, results }) => {
  const unverified = results.filter(r => r.status !== 'verified')
  if (unverified.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'sustainability-officer',
      message: `Technology ${technologyId} has unverified claims: ${unverified.map(u => u.certification).join(', ')}`
    })
  }
})

// Automatically recommend based on sustainability score
greenTech.sustainabilityScored(async ({ technologyId, score, breakdown }) => {
  if (score > 85 && breakdown.emissions < 20) {
    await notify({
      to: 'green-procurement-specialist',
      message: `Technology ${technologyId} achieves high sustainability score (${score}/100) with low emissions profile`
    })
  }
})
```
