# Provide Safety Training

> Business-as-Code definition for providing safety training. Models the process of designing, delivering, and certifying workplace and operational safety instruction to ensure regulatory compliance and reduce incidents.

## Overview

Providing safety training involves developing and delivering instructional programs that teach employees, contractors, and visitors how to identify hazards, follow safe work practices, use personal protective equipment, and respond to emergencies. Training is typically mandated by OSHA, industry regulations, or organizational policy and covers topics such as lockout/tagout, fall protection, hazardous materials handling, and confined space entry. Effective safety training reduces workplace injuries, lowers workers' compensation costs, and maintains regulatory compliance.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { provideSafetyTraining } from '@headlessly/provide-safety-training'

const safety = provideSafetyTraining()

// Develop a new confined space entry course
const course = await safety.developCourse({
  title: 'Confined Space Entry and Rescue',
  regulation: 'OSHA-29-CFR-1910.146',
  topics: ['hazard-identification', 'atmospheric-testing', 'entry-permits', 'rescue-procedures'],
  duration: { hours: 8 },
  handsOnRequired: true
})

// Schedule a training session
await safety.scheduleSession({
  courseId: course.id,
  date: '2026-04-15',
  location: 'Plant B Training Center',
  trainees: ['emp-4401', 'emp-4402', 'emp-4403', 'contractor-891']
})

// Audit compliance across the facility
const gaps = await safety.auditCompliance({
  facility: 'manufacturing-plant-b',
  regulations: ['OSHA-29-CFR-1910.146', 'OSHA-29-CFR-1910.147'],
  asOfDate: '2026-04-01'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Automatically schedule remedial training on assessment failure
safety.assessmentAdministered(async ({ traineeId, courseId, passed }) => {
  if (!passed) {
    await safety.scheduleSession({
      courseId,
      trainees: [traineeId],
      type: 'remedial',
      deadline: '2-weeks'
    })
  }
})

// Alert safety manager when compliance gaps are found
safety.complianceAudited(async ({ facility, gaps }) => {
  if (gaps.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'safety-manager',
      message: `${gaps.length} training compliance gaps found at ${facility}`,
      priority: 'high'
    })
  }
})
```
