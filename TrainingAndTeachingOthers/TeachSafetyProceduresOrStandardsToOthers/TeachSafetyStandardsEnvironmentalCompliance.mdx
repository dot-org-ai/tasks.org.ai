This includes OSHA standards, EPA regulations, ISO 14001 environmental management systems, and industry-specific requirements for hazardous waste handling, emissions monitoring, and spill prevention. Instruction combines classroom learning with field exercises to ensure personnel can apply compliance methods in their daily operations.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { teachSafetyStandardsEnvironmentalCompliance } from '@headlessly/teach-safety-standards-environmental-compliance'

const compliance = teachSafetyStandardsEnvironmentalCompliance()

// Identify applicable regulations for a manufacturing facility
const requirements = await compliance.identifyRequirements({
  facility: 'chemical-plant-east',
  activities: ['hazardous-waste-storage', 'air-emissions', 'stormwater-discharge'],
  frameworks: ['EPA-RCRA', 'OSHA-HAZWOPER', 'ISO-14001']
})

// Develop a hazardous waste handling module
const module = await compliance.developModule({
  title: 'RCRA Hazardous Waste Generator Compliance',
  regulation: 'EPA-40-CFR-262',
  topics: ['waste-characterization', 'container-management', 'manifest-tracking', 'emergency-response'],
  fieldExercise: 'spill-containment-drill'
})

// Assess trainee comprehension
const result = await compliance.assessComprehension({
  traineeId: 'emp-5567',
  moduleId: module.id,
  format: 'written-and-practical',
  passingScore: 80
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert environmental manager when regulations change
compliance.regulationsUpdated(async ({ regulation, effectiveDate, changes }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'environmental-manager',
    message: `Regulation ${regulation} updated effective ${effectiveDate}`,
    details: changes
  })
})

// Auto-schedule re-training when audit findings indicate gaps
compliance.comprehensionAssessed(async ({ traineeId, moduleId, passed }) => {
  if (!passed) {
    await compliance.deliverInstruction({
      moduleId,
      trainees: [traineeId],
      type: 'remedial',
      deadline: '30-days'
    })
  }
})
```
