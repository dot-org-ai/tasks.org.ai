# Educate Public About Fire Safety

> Business-as-Code definition for educating the public about fire safety or prevention. Models the community outreach and instructional process of reducing fire-related injuries and property losses through awareness campaigns and training programs.

## Overview

Educating the public about fire safety or prevention involves developing and delivering community outreach programs that teach fire hazard recognition, evacuation planning, smoke alarm maintenance, and proper use of fire extinguishers.
