# Teach Others Use Computer Equipment

> Business-as-Code definition for teaching others to use computer equipment and hardware. Models the training process for workstations, peripherals, network devices, and specialized computing hardware from setup through proficient daily use.

## Overview

Teaching others to use computer equipment or hardware involves assessing user familiarity, providing instruction on hardware setup and configuration, demonstrating proper operation and troubleshooting, and verifying that users can independently perform required tasks. This definition exposes actions for training delivery and skill evaluation, events for tracking user readiness, and searches for retrieving training records and equipment inventories.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { teachOthersUseComputerEquipment } from '@headlessly/teach-others-use-computer-equipment'

const hwTraining = teachOthersUseComputerEquipment()

// Assess a new employee's hardware proficiency
const profile = await hwTraining.assessProficiency({
  userId: 'EMP-2024-0456',
  areas: ['workstation-setup', 'monitor-configuration', 'printer-setup', 'vpn-hardware-token', 'docking-station']
})

// Conduct workstation setup training
await hwTraining.conductSetupTraining({
  userId: 'EMP-2024-0456',
  equipment: ['Dell Latitude 5540', 'Dell U2723QE Monitor', 'WD19TBS Thunderbolt Dock'],
  topics: ['docking-connection', 'dual-monitor-setup', 'peripheral-pairing', 'power-management']
})

// Verify competency
const result = await hwTraining.verifyCompetency({
  userId: 'EMP-2024-0456',
  tasks: ['dock-laptop', 'configure-displays', 'connect-printer', 'use-hardware-vpn-token'],
  assessorId: 'IT-TRAIN-008'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify help desk that user is self-sufficient
hwTraining.competencyVerified(async ({ userId, equipment }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'help-desk',
    message: `User ${userId} has completed hardware training and is self-sufficient on ${equipment.join(', ')}`
  })
})

// Auto-schedule follow-up for users needing more practice
hwTraining.proficiencyAssessed(async ({ userId, gaps }) => {
  if (gaps.length > 0) {
    await hwTraining.scheduleTraining({
      userId,
      focusAreas: gaps,
      format: 'one-on-one',
      priority: 'standard'
    })
  }
})
```
