# Teach Others Use Technology Equipment

> Business-as-Code definition for teaching others to use technology and equipment. Models the end-to-end training process for technology adoption, covering needs assessment, instructional design, hands-on practice, and user proficiency verification.

## Overview

Teaching others to use technology or equipment involves evaluating user skill levels, developing technology-specific training content, delivering instruction through demonstrations and guided practice, and measuring adoption success. This definition exposes actions for training program management and learner assessment, events for tracking technology adoption milestones, and searches for retrieving training and proficiency data.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { teachOthersUseTechnologyEquipment } from '@headlessly/teach-others-use-technology-equipment'

const techTraining = teachOthersUseTechnologyEquipment()

// Assess skill levels for a department
const assessments = await techTraining.assessSkillLevel({
  technology: 'Salesforce CRM',
  department: 'Sales',
  learners: ['USR-0101', 'USR-0102', 'USR-0103'],
  areas: ['navigation', 'data-entry', 'reporting', 'dashboard-creation']
})

// Design a training program
const program = await techTraining.designProgram({
  technology: 'Salesforce CRM',
  modules: ['platform-overview', 'contact-management', 'opportunity-tracking', 'report-builder', 'mobile-app'],
  deliveryMethod: 'blended',
  duration: '3-days'
})

// Measure technology adoption after training
const metrics = await techTraining.measureAdoption({
  technology: 'Salesforce CRM',
  department: 'Sales',
  metrics: ['daily-active-users', 'feature-utilization', 'support-tickets'],
  period: 'post-30-days'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Schedule follow-up coaching for proficiency gaps
techTraining.proficiencyGap(async ({ learnerId, technology, gaps }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'support-coach',
    message: `Learner ${learnerId} needs additional coaching on ${technology}: ${gaps.join(', ')}`
  })
})

// Report adoption milestones to management
techTraining.adoptionMeasured(async ({ technology, department, adoptionRate }) => {
  if (adoptionRate >= 0.9) {
    await notify({
      to: 'management',
      message: `${department} has achieved ${Math.round(adoptionRate * 100)}% adoption of ${technology}`
    })
  }
})
```
