# Train Others Computer Interface Software

> Business-as-Code definition for training others in computer interface or software use. Models the process of assessing skill gaps, designing instructional sessions, delivering hands-on software training, and evaluating learner proficiency.

## Overview

Training others in computer interface or software use involves identifying user skill levels, developing instructional materials tailored to specific applications, conducting training sessions, and measuring post-training competency. This definition exposes actions for curriculum development and session delivery, events for tracking learner progress, and searches for managing training schedules and completion records.

## Actors

| Actor | Description |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { trainOthersComputerInterfaceSoftware } from '@headlessly/train-others-computer-interface-software'

const training = trainOthersComputerInterfaceSoftware()

// Assess current skill levels
const assessment = await training.assessSkillGap({
  userId: 'USR-3301',
  application: 'SAP S/4HANA',
  requiredCompetencies: ['navigation', 'reporting', 'data-entry']
})

// Schedule a training session
const session = await training.scheduleSession({
  curriculumId: 'CUR-SAP-101',
  date: '2026-03-15',
  format: 'instructor-led',
  participants: ['USR-3301', 'USR-3302', 'USR-3303'],
  location: 'Training Lab B'
})

// Evaluate competency after training
const result = await training.evaluateCompetency({
  sessionId: session.id,
  userId: 'USR-3301',
  assessmentType: 'hands-on-exercise'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-issue certificates on passing
training.competencyEvaluated(async ({ sessionId, userId, score, passingScore }) => {
  if (score >= passingScore) {
    await training.issueCertificate({ sessionId, userId })
  }
})

// Notify managers of incomplete training
training.sessionScheduled(async ({ sessionId, participants }) => {
  for (const userId of participants) {
    await notify({
      to: getManager(userId),
      message: `${userId} has been enrolled in software training session ${sessionId}`
    })
  }
})
```
