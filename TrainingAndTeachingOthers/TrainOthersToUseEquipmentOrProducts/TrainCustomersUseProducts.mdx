## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { trainCustomersUseProducts } from '@headlessly/train-customers-use-products'

const productTraining = trainCustomersUseProducts()

// Create an onboarding plan for a new enterprise customer
const plan = await productTraining.createOnboardingPlan({
  customerId: 'CUST-2024-0089',
  product: 'Enterprise Analytics Platform',
  users: 25,
  modules: ['dashboard-setup', 'data-connectors', 'report-builder', 'user-management', 'api-integration'],
  targetCompletionDate: '2026-04-15'
})

// Deliver feature-specific training
await productTraining.deliverFeatureTraining({
  customerId: 'CUST-2024-0089',
  module: 'report-builder',
  attendees: ['user-01', 'user-02', 'user-03'],
  format: 'live-virtual',
  duration: 90
})

// Measure product adoption
const adoption = await productTraining.measureAdoption({
  customerId: 'CUST-2024-0089',
  metrics: ['daily-active-users', 'reports-created', 'dashboards-viewed', 'api-calls'],
  period: 'post-30-days'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert customer success when adoption is low
productTraining.adoptionMeasured(async ({ customerId, adoptionScore, threshold }) => {
  if (adoptionScore < threshold) {
    await notify({
      to: 'customer-success',
      message: `Customer ${customerId} adoption score is ${adoptionScore}% (below ${threshold}% target) - intervention recommended`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-send resources after feature training
productTraining.featureTrainingDelivered(async ({ customerId, module }) => {
  await productTraining.provideResources({
    customerId,
    resources: [`${module}-quick-start-guide`, `${module}-video-walkthrough`, `${module}-faq`]
  })
})
```
