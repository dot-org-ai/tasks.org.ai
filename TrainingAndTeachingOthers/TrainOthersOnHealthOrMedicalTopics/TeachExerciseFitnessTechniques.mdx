## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { teachExerciseFitnessTechniques } from '@headlessly/teach-exercise-fitness-techniques'

const fitness = teachExerciseFitnessTechniques()

// Assess a new client's fitness level
const assessment = await fitness.assessFitness({
  clientId: 'client-3301',
  tests: ['body-composition', 'one-rep-max-squat', 'mile-run', 'sit-and-reach'],
  healthClearance: 'physician-approved'
})

// Design a personalized strength training program
const program = await fitness.designProgram({
  clientId: 'client-3301',
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  goal: 'muscle-hypertrophy',
  frequency: '4-days-per-week',
  duration: { weeks: 12 },
  exercises: ['barbell-squat', 'bench-press', 'deadlift', 'overhead-press']
})

// Track performance after a training block
const metrics = await fitness.trackPerformance({
  clientId: 'client-3301',
  programId: program.id,
  week: 4,
  data: { squatMax: 275, benchMax: 205, mileTime: '7:45' }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Adjust program when performance plateaus
fitness.performanceTracked(async ({ clientId, programId, trend }) => {
  if (trend === 'plateau' && trend.durationWeeks >= 3) {
    await fitness.adjustProgram({
      clientId,
      programId,
      modification: 'deload-week-then-progressive-overload'
    })
  }
})

// Notify client when fitness assessment shows improvement
fitness.fitnessAssessed(async ({ clientId, comparison }) => {
  if (comparison.improvement > 10) {
    await notify({
      to: clientId,
      message: `Great progress! Your fitness score improved by ${comparison.improvement}%`
    })
  }
})
```
