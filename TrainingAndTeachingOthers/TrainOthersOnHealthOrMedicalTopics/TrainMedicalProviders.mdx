# Train Medical Providers

> Business-as-Code definition for training medical providers. Models the continuing education and clinical skills development process for physicians, nurses, and allied health professionals to maintain competency and adopt evidence-based practices.

## Overview

Training medical providers involves designing and delivering continuing medical education (CME), clinical skills workshops, simulation exercises, and competency assessments for physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and allied health professionals. This process ensures providers remain current with evidence-based protocols, new treatment modalities, regulatory requirements, and technological advances. Training may occur through grand rounds, simulation labs, online modules, and supervised clinical practice, with outcomes tracked through credentialing and quality metrics.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { trainMedicalProviders } from '@headlessly/train-medical-providers'

const medTraining = trainMedicalProviders()

// Develop a CME program for emergency medicine providers
const program = await medTraining.developCMEProgram({
  title: 'Advanced Trauma Life Support Update 2026',
  specialty: 'emergency-medicine',
  accreditor: 'ACCME',
  credits: 16,
  topics: ['hemorrhage-control', 'airway-management', 'chest-trauma', 'tbi-protocols']
})

// Schedule a simulation session
await medTraining.scheduleClinicalTraining({
  programId: program.id,
  type: 'simulation',
  date: '2026-05-20',
  providers: ['dr-chen', 'dr-patel', 'rn-martinez'],
  location: 'Simulation Center Building A'
})

// Assess competency after the training
const assessment = await medTraining.assessCompetency({
  providerId: 'dr-chen',
  programId: program.id,
  format: 'observed-structured-clinical-exam',
  passingThreshold: 85
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-notify providers when certifications are expiring
medTraining.credentialsMaintained(async ({ providerId, expiringCerts }) => {
  for (const cert of expiringCerts) {
    if (cert.daysUntilExpiry <= 90) {
      await notify({
        to: providerId,
        message: `Your ${cert.name} certification expires on ${cert.expiryDate}. Please complete renewal requirements.`
      })
    }
  }
})

// Award credits automatically upon competency confirmation
medTraining.competencyAssessed(async ({ providerId, programId, passed }) => {
  if (passed) {
    await medTraining.awardCMECredits({
      providerId,
      programId,
      creditType: 'category-1'
    })
  }
})
```
