# Teach Physical Education

> Business-as-Code definition for physical education instruction. Models the planning, delivery, and assessment of physical fitness curricula across schools, recreation programs, and athletic training facilities.

## Overview

Teaching physical education involves designing age-appropriate fitness curricula, instructing students in sports and movement skills, monitoring physical development, and promoting lifelong healthy habits. This definition exposes actions for lesson planning and delivery, events for tracking student progress, and searches for retrieving fitness assessment data.

| adaptActivity | Modify activities for students with physical limitations |
| trackProgress | Record student performance against fitness benchmarks |
| manageSafety | Enforce safety protocols and inspect equipment before use |
| assignSkillDrill | Assign targeted drills to improve specific movement skills |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| lessonPlanCreated | A new physical education lesson plan has been finalized |
| classCompleted | A physical education session has been delivered |
| fitnessAssessed | A student fitness assessment has been recorded |
| activityAdapted | An activity has been modified for accessibility |
| progressUpdated | Student performance records have been updated |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { teachPhysicalEducation } from '@headlessly/teach-physical-education'

const pe = teachPhysicalEducation()

// Create a lesson plan for middle school basketball
const lesson = await pe.createLessonPlan({
  title: 'Basketball Fundamentals - Dribbling and Passing',
  gradeLevel: '6-8',
  duration: 45,
  objectives: ['Demonstrate proper dribbling form', 'Execute chest and bounce passes'],
  equipment: ['basketballs', 'cones', 'pinnies']
})

// Assess student fitness
const assessment = await pe.assessFitness({
  studentId: 'STU-2024-0847',
  testType: 'FITNESSGRAM',
  metrics: {
    pacerLaps: 42,
    curlUps: 35,
    pushUps: 18,
    flexibilityReach: 8.5
  }
})

// Track progress against benchmarks
await pe.trackProgress({
  studentId: 'STU-2024-0847',
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  period: 'Q2'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify parents when a student achieves a fitness benchmark
pe.benchmarkAchieved(async ({ studentId, benchmark, score }) => {
  await notify({
    to: `parent-of-${studentId}`,
    message: `Your student achieved the ${benchmark} benchmark with a score of ${score}`
  })
})

// Alert administration on safety incidents
pe.safetyIncidentReported(async ({ classId, incident, severity }) => {
  if (severity === 'high') {
    await notify({
      to: 'school-administration',
      message: `Safety incident reported in PE class ${classId}: ${incident}`
    })
  }
})
```
