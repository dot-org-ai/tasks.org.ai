# Teach Health Hygiene Practices

> Business-as-Code definition for teaching health or hygiene practices. Models the educational process of instructing individuals and communities in personal hygiene, infection prevention, sanitation, and health maintenance behaviors.

## Overview

Teaching health or hygiene practices involves educating individuals, families, and community groups in personal hygiene routines, handwashing techniques, oral health care, food safety, sanitation, and disease prevention.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { teachHealthHygienePractices } from '@headlessly/teach-health-hygiene-practices'

const hygiene = teachHealthHygienePractices()

// Assess hygiene practices in a target community
const assessment = await hygiene.assessHygienePractices({
  population: 'elementary-school-district-12',
  practices: ['handwashing-frequency', 'oral-care-routine', 'food-handling'],
  sampleSize: 500
})

// Develop a culturally adapted curriculum
const curriculum = await hygiene.developCurriculum({
  title: 'Healthy Hands, Healthy Lives',
  audience: 'grades-k-5',
  topics: ['handwashing', 'cough-etiquette', 'dental-hygiene', 'safe-food-preparation'],
  languages: ['en', 'es'],
  duration: { sessions: 6, minutesPerSession: 45 }
})

// Measure outcomes after the program
const outcomes = await hygiene.measureOutcomes({
  curriculumId: curriculum.id,
  indicators: ['handwashing-compliance-rate', 'absenteeism-reduction', 'cavity-rate-change'],
  comparisonPeriod: 'pre-post-6-months'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Distribute hygiene kits after a session
hygiene.sessionConducted(async ({ sessionId, attendees, topic }) => {
  if (topic === 'handwashing') {
    await hygiene.distributeResources({
      sessionId,
      items: ['hand-sanitizer', 'soap-bar', 'hygiene-poster'],
      recipients: attendees
    })
  }
})

// Alert program evaluator when outcomes show no improvement
hygiene.outcomesMeasured(async ({ curriculumId, indicators }) => {
  const declining = indicators.filter(i => i.trend === 'no-change' || i.trend === 'declining')
  if (declining.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'program-evaluator',
      message: `Curriculum ${curriculumId} shows no improvement in: ${declining.map(d => d.name).join(', ')}`
    })
  }
})
```
