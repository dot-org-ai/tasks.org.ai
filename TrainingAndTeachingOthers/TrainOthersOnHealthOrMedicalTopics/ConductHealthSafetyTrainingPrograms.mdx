## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { conductHealthSafetyTrainingPrograms } from '@headlessly/conduct-health-safety-training-programs'

const training = conductHealthSafetyTrainingPrograms()

// Design a bloodborne pathogens training program
const program = await training.designProgram({
  title: 'Annual Bloodborne Pathogens Training',
  regulation: 'OSHA-29-CFR-1910.1030',
  topics: ['exposure-control-plan', 'universal-precautions', 'post-exposure-procedures', 'ppe-selection'],
  format: 'hybrid-classroom-and-online',
  requiredFor: ['clinical-staff', 'maintenance', 'housekeeping']
})

// Register participants for an upcoming session
await training.registerParticipants({
  programId: program.id,
  sessionDate: '2026-03-10',
  participants: ['emp-2201', 'emp-2202', 'emp-2203', 'emp-2204'],
  location: 'Conference Room B'
})

// Report compliance to leadership
const report = await training.reportCompliance({
  programId: program.id,
  period: 'Q1-2026',
  metrics: ['completion-rate', 'average-quiz-score', 'overdue-count']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-issue certificates when quiz is passed
training.quizAdministered(async ({ participantId, programId, score, passingScore }) => {
  if (score >= passingScore) {
    await training.issueCompletion({
      participantId,
      programId,
      certificateType: 'annual-compliance'
    })
  }
})

// Escalate when compliance rate drops below threshold
training.complianceReported(async ({ programId, completionRate }) => {
  if (completionRate < 0.90) {
    await notify({
      to: 'compliance-officer',
      message: `Training program ${programId} has only ${Math.round(completionRate * 100)}% completion rate`,
      priority: 'high'
    })
  }
})
```
