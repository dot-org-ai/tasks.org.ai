## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { teachHealthManagementClasses } from '@headlessly/teach-health-management-classes'

const healthEd = teachHealthManagementClasses()

// Develop a diabetes self-management curriculum
const curriculum = await healthEd.developCurriculum({
  topic: 'Diabetes Self-Management',
  sessions: 6,
  objectives: ['blood-glucose-monitoring', 'nutrition-planning', 'medication-adherence', 'foot-care'],
  targetAudience: 'Adults with Type 2 Diabetes'
})

// Schedule a class series
const classSession = await healthEd.scheduleClass({
  curriculumId: curriculum.id,
  startDate: '2026-03-01',
  frequency: 'weekly',
  time: '18:00',
  location: 'Community Health Center - Room 204',
  maxEnrollment: 20
})

// Evaluate program outcomes
const outcomes = await healthEd.evaluateOutcomes({
  classId: classSession.id,
  metrics: ['knowledge-score-improvement', 'hba1c-reduction', 'self-efficacy-rating'],
  period: 'post-6-months'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify referring provider when their patient completes the class series
healthEd.outcomesEvaluated(async ({ participantId, classId, metrics }) => {
  const enrollment = await healthEd.getEnrollments({ participantId, classId })
  if (enrollment.referringProviderId) {
    await notify({
      to: enrollment.referringProviderId,
      message: `Patient ${participantId} completed health management class with ${metrics.knowledgeImprovement}% knowledge improvement`
    })
  }
})

// Waitlist management when class is full
healthEd.participantEnrolled(async ({ classId, currentEnrollment, maxEnrollment }) => {
  if (currentEnrollment >= maxEnrollment) {
    await healthEd.scheduleClass({
      curriculumId: classId,
      note: 'Additional section opened due to demand'
    })
  }
})
```
