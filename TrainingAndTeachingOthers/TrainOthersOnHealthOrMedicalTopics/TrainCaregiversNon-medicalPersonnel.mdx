## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { trainCaregiversNonMedicalPersonnel } from '@headlessly/train-caregivers-non-medical-personnel'

const training = trainCaregiversNonMedicalPersonnel()

// Create a home health aide training program
const program = await training.createProgram({
  name: 'Home Health Aide Certification',
  modules: ['personal-care', 'infection-control', 'nutrition-hydration', 'mobility-transfers', 'emergency-response', 'documentation'],
  requiredHours: 75,
  regulatoryStandard: 'State HHA Requirements'
})

// Enroll a trainee
await training.enrollTrainee({
  programId: program.id,
  traineeId: 'AIDE-2024-0198',
  startDate: '2026-02-10',
  employerId: 'Home Care Solutions Inc.'
})

// Conduct a skills checkoff
const result = await training.conductSkillsCheckoff({
  traineeId: 'AIDE-2024-0198',
  skills: ['safe-patient-transfer', 'vital-signs-measurement', 'proper-hand-hygiene'],
  assessorId: 'RN-SUPV-0012',
  outcome: 'pass'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify employer when certification is issued
training.certificationIssued(async ({ traineeId, certification }) => {
  await notify({
    to: certification.employerId,
    message: `${traineeId} has completed ${certification.name} and is cleared for patient assignments`
  })
})

// Alert on upcoming certification expirations
training.certificationExpiring(async ({ traineeId, certification, daysRemaining }) => {
  if (daysRemaining <= 30) {
    await notify({
      to: traineeId,
      message: `Your ${certification.name} expires in ${daysRemaining} days - complete continuing education to renew`
    })
  }
})
```
