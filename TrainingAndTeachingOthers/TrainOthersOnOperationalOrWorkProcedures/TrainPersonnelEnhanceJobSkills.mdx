## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { trainPersonnelEnhanceJobSkills } from '@headlessly/train-personnel-enhance-job-skills'

const skillDev = trainPersonnelEnhanceJobSkills()

// Assess current skills and identify gaps
const assessment = await skillDev.assessCurrentSkills({
  employeeId: 'emp-701',
  roleId: 'senior-data-analyst',
  skills: ['sql-querying', 'statistical-modeling', 'data-visualization', 'stakeholder-presentation']
})

const gaps = await skillDev.identifySkillGaps({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  targetProfile: 'senior-data-analyst'
})

// Create a development plan
const plan = await skillDev.createDevelopmentPlan({
  employeeId: 'emp-701',
  targetSkills: gaps.skills,
  timeline: { months: 3 },
  activities: ['online-courses', 'mentoring-sessions', 'project-assignments']
})

// Schedule and deliver training
await skillDev.scheduleSkillTraining({
  planId: plan.id,
  sessions: [
    { skill: 'statistical-modeling', date: '2026-04-10', format: 'workshop' },
    { skill: 'stakeholder-presentation', date: '2026-04-17', format: 'coaching' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Certify proficiency when targets are met
skillDev.skillProgressionMeasured(async ({ employeeId, planId, allTargetsMet }) => {
  if (allTargetsMet) {
    await skillDev.certifySkillProficiency({
      employeeId,
      planId,
      certificationDate: new Date().toISOString()
    })
  }
})

// Notify supervisor when skill gaps are identified
skillDev.skillGapsIdentified(async ({ employeeId, gaps }) => {
  const supervisor = await getSupervisorFor(employeeId)
  await notify({
    to: supervisor.id,
    message: `Skill gaps identified for ${employeeId}: ${gaps.map(g => g.skillName).join(', ')}`
  })
})
```
