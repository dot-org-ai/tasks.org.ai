## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { trainTransportationMaterialMovingPersonnel } from '@headlessly/train-transportation-material-moving-personnel'

const transport = trainTransportationMaterialMovingPersonnel()

// Assess operator readiness
const readiness = await transport.assessOperatorReadiness({
  candidateId: 'OPR-3301',
  equipmentType: 'Class-A-CDL',
  physicalExam: { date: '2026-02-01', status: 'passed' },
  writtenTest: { score: 88, passingScore: 80 }
})

// Deliver safety training
await transport.deliverSafetyTraining({
  courseId: 'CRS-DEF-DRIVING-2026',
  participants: ['OPR-3301', 'OPR-3302'],
  topics: ['Defensive Driving', 'Pre-Trip Inspection', 'Hazmat Awareness'],
  format: 'classroom-plus-practical',
  hours: 16
})

// Certify the operator
await transport.certifyOperator({
  operatorId: 'OPR-3301',
  certification: 'Forklift-Operator',
  certifiedDate: '2026-03-01',
  validUntil: '2029-03-01',
  issuedBy: 'TRN-040'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on expiring certifications
transport.renewalScheduled(async ({ operatorId, certification, renewalDate }) => {
  await scheduleReminder({
    date: daysBeforeDate(renewalDate, 60),
    to: operatorId,
    message: `Your ${certification} certification expires on ${renewalDate}. Please schedule renewal training.`
  })
})

// Auto-update compliance records on certification
transport.operatorCertified(async ({ operatorId, certification, certifiedDate }) => {
  await transport.updateComplianceRecords({
    operatorId,
    regulation: certification.includes('CDL') ? 'DOT-FMCSA' : 'OSHA-1910.178',
    completedDate: certifiedDate
  })
})
```
