# Train Workers Farming Forestry Hunting

> Business-as-Code definition for training workers in farming, forestry, or hunting techniques. Models the process of designing field-based instruction programs, delivering hands-on training in agricultural and natural resource operations, and certifying worker readiness.

## Overview

Training workers in farming, forestry, or hunting techniques involves instructing personnel on safe and effective methods for crop cultivation, livestock management, timber harvesting, wildlife management, and related outdoor operations. This definition exposes actions for developing field-specific curricula, conducting on-site training demonstrations, assessing practical competency, and maintaining compliance with environmental and safety regulations governing agricultural and natural resource work.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { trainWorkersFarmingForestryHunting } from '@headlessly/train-workers-farming-forestry-hunting'

const fieldTraining = trainWorkersFarmingForestryHunting()

// Develop a forestry training curriculum
const curriculum = await fieldTraining.developFieldCurriculum({
  discipline: 'timber-harvesting',
  techniques: ['chainsaw-operation', 'felling-direction-control', 'log-skidding'],
  safetyModules: ['ppe-requirements', 'hazard-tree-identification']
})

// Schedule on-site training
const session = await fieldTraining.scheduleFieldTraining({
  programId: curriculum.id,
  location: 'North Ridge Timber Unit',
  scheduledDate: '2026-04-10',
  participantIds: ['wkr-201', 'wkr-202', 'wkr-203']
})

// Assess competency after demonstration
const results = await fieldTraining.assessFieldCompetency({
  sessionId: session.id,
  evaluationCriteria: ['safety-compliance', 'technique-accuracy', 'efficiency']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-issue certifications when competency is met
fieldTraining.fieldCompetencyAssessed(async ({ participantId, passed, sessionId }) => {
  if (passed) {
    await fieldTraining.issueCertification({
      workerId: participantId,
      sessionId,
      type: 'forestry-safety',
      validUntil: '2027-04-10'
    })
  }
})

// Alert compliance officer when training gaps are found
fieldTraining.trainingComplianceRecorded(async ({ siteId, gapsFound }) => {
  if (gapsFound > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'compliance-team',
      message: `Site ${siteId} has ${gapsFound} outstanding training requirements`
    })
  }
})
```
