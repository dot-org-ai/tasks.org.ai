## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { trainEmployeesEnvironmentalAwarenessConservation } from '@headlessly/train-employees-environmental-awareness-conservation'

const envTraining = trainEmployeesEnvironmentalAwarenessConservation()

// Develop environmental training curriculum
const program = await envTraining.developEnvironmentalCurriculum({
  title: 'Annual Environmental Compliance Training',
  topics: ['waste-management', 'hazardous-material-handling', 'spill-response', 'energy-conservation'],
  regulations: ['epa-rcra', 'osha-hazcom', 'state-environmental-code']
})

// Schedule and deliver training
const session = await envTraining.scheduleSafetyTraining({
  programId: program.id,
  participantIds: ['emp-601', 'emp-602', 'emp-603'],
  scheduledDate: '2026-04-15',
  location: 'Environmental Training Center'
})

// Conduct a safety drill
await envTraining.conductSafetyDrill({
  sessionId: session.id,
  drillType: 'chemical-spill-response',
  scenario: 'laboratory-spill-containment'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-certify employees after passing competency assessment
envTraining.environmentalCompetencyAssessed(async ({ employeeId, passed, programId }) => {
  if (passed) {
    await envTraining.issueComplianceCertification({
      employeeId,
      programId,
      type: 'environmental-compliance',
      validUntil: '2027-04-15'
    })
  }
})

// Alert compliance team when audit finds gaps
envTraining.trainingComplianceAudited(async ({ departmentId, gapsFound, regulations }) => {
  if (gapsFound > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'compliance-team',
      message: `Department ${departmentId} has ${gapsFound} outstanding environmental training requirements for ${regulations.join(', ')}`
    })
  }
})
```
