## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { trainServiceStaff } from '@headlessly/train-service-staff'

const serviceTraining = trainServiceStaff()

// Design a service training program
const program = await serviceTraining.designServiceTraining({
  name: 'Customer Service Excellence Program',
  modules: ['active-listening', 'conflict-de-escalation', 'product-knowledge', 'upselling-techniques'],
  targetRole: 'front-desk-representative',
  duration: { days: 3 }
})

// Schedule and deliver training
const session = await serviceTraining.scheduleServiceTraining({
  programId: program.id,
  participantIds: ['rep-301', 'rep-302', 'rep-303'],
  scheduledDate: '2026-04-07',
  format: 'in-person-workshop'
})

// Conduct role-play and assess competency
await serviceTraining.conductRolePlayExercise({
  sessionId: session.id,
  scenarios: ['difficult-customer-complaint', 'product-return-request', 'loyalty-program-inquiry']
})

const assessment = await serviceTraining.assessServiceCompetency({
  sessionId: session.id,
  participantId: 'rep-301',
  criteria: ['communication-clarity', 'empathy', 'problem-resolution', 'protocol-adherence']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-record completion when competency is confirmed
serviceTraining.serviceCompetencyAssessed(async ({ participantId, passed, programId }) => {
  if (passed) {
    await serviceTraining.recordTrainingCompletion({
      staffId: participantId,
      programId,
      completionDate: new Date().toISOString()
    })
  }
})

// Schedule coaching for staff who need improvement
serviceTraining.serviceCompetencyAssessed(async ({ participantId, passed, weakAreas }) => {
  if (!passed) {
    await serviceTraining.provideCoachingFeedback({
      staffId: participantId,
      focusAreas: weakAreas,
      followUpDate: nextWeek()
    })
  }
})
```
