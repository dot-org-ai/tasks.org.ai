## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { trainStaffMembers } from '@headlessly/train-staff-members'

const training = trainStaffMembers()

// Conduct a needs assessment
const needs = await training.conductNeedsAssessment({
  department: 'Operations',
  roles: ['Coordinator', 'Analyst', 'Specialist'],
  period: 'FY2026'
})

// Create a training program
const program = await training.createTrainingProgram({
  name: 'Operations Excellence Fundamentals',
  objectives: ['Process documentation standards', 'Data analysis techniques', 'Cross-functional communication'],
  format: 'blended',
  sessions: 6,
  duration: { weeks: 3 }
})

// Enroll staff
await training.enrollStaff({
  programId: program.id,
  staffIds: needs.priorityStaff,
  startDate: '2026-04-07'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Update records automatically on session completion
training.sessionDelivered(async ({ sessionId, attendees }) => {
  for (const staffId of attendees) {
    await training.updateDevelopmentRecord({
      staffId,
      sessionId,
      completedDate: new Date().toISOString()
    })
  }
})

// Notify managers of low evaluation scores
training.trainingEvaluated(async ({ programId, averageScore, threshold }) => {
  if (averageScore < threshold) {
    await notify({
      to: 'training-leadership',
      message: `Program ${programId} scored ${averageScore}/${threshold}. Consider curriculum revision.`
    })
  }
})
```
