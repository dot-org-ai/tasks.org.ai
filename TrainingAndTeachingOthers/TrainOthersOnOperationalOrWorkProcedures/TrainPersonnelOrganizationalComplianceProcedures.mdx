## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { trainPersonnelOrganizationalComplianceProcedures } from '@headlessly/train-personnel-organizational-compliance-procedures'

const compliance = trainPersonnelOrganizationalComplianceProcedures()

// Define compliance requirements
const requirements = await compliance.defineComplianceRequirements({
  regulation: 'OSHA-29CFR1910',
  topics: ['Hazard Communication', 'Personal Protective Equipment', 'Lockout/Tagout'],
  frequency: 'annual',
  applicableDepartments: ['Manufacturing', 'Warehouse']
})

// Assign training to employees
await compliance.assignTraining({
  moduleId: 'MOD-OSHA-2026',
  employeeIds: ['EMP-4001', 'EMP-4002', 'EMP-4003'],
  deadline: '2026-04-30'
})

// Generate an audit report
const report = await compliance.generateAuditReport({
  department: 'Manufacturing',
  period: { start: '2026-01-01', end: '2026-03-31' },
  includeNonCompliant: true
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Escalate non-completion before deadline
compliance.trainingAssigned(async ({ moduleId, employeeIds, deadline }) => {
  await scheduleReminder({
    date: daysBeforeDate(deadline, 7),
    action: async () => {
      const incomplete = await compliance.findNonCompliantPersonnel({ moduleId })
      if (incomplete.length > 0) {
        await notify({
          to: 'compliance-officer',
          message: `${incomplete.length} employees have not completed ${moduleId} with 7 days remaining`
        })
      }
    }
  })
})

// Auto-reassign training on regulation change
compliance.complianceContentUpdated(async ({ moduleId, regulation }) => {
  const affected = await compliance.getComplianceRecords({ moduleId })
  for (const record of affected) {
    await compliance.assignTraining({
      moduleId,
      employeeIds: [record.employeeId],
      deadline: addDays(new Date(), 30)
    })
  }
})
```
