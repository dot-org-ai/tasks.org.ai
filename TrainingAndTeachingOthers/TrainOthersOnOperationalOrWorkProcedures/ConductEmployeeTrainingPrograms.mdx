## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { conductEmployeeTrainingPrograms } from '@headlessly/conduct-employee-training-programs'

const training = conductEmployeeTrainingPrograms()

// Design a new training program
const program = await training.designTrainingProgram({
  name: 'Q2 Leadership Development Program',
  objectives: ['strategic-thinking', 'team-management', 'conflict-resolution'],
  modules: [
    { title: 'Leading Through Change', format: 'workshop', duration: { hours: 4 } },
    { title: 'Performance Coaching', format: 'seminar', duration: { hours: 3 } },
    { title: 'Decision Making Under Pressure', format: 'simulation', duration: { hours: 2 } }
  ],
  targetAudience: 'mid-level-managers'
})

// Enroll participants and schedule sessions
await training.enrollParticipants({
  programId: program.id,
  employeeIds: ['emp-201', 'emp-202', 'emp-203', 'emp-204'],
  enrollmentDeadline: '2026-03-15'
})

await training.scheduleTrainingSessions({
  programId: program.id,
  sessions: [
    { moduleIndex: 0, date: '2026-04-05', location: 'Conference Room A' },
    { moduleIndex: 1, date: '2026-04-12', location: 'Virtual' },
    { moduleIndex: 2, date: '2026-04-19', location: 'Simulation Lab' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Generate effectiveness report after all sessions complete
training.learningOutcomesAssessed(async ({ programId, sessionCount, totalSessions }) => {
  if (sessionCount === totalSessions) {
    await training.collectProgramFeedback({ programId })
    await training.reportProgramEffectiveness({ programId })
  }
})

// Notify managers when their team members complete training
training.trainingSessionDelivered(async ({ programId, participantIds }) => {
  for (const participantId of participantIds) {
    const manager = await getManagerFor(participantId)
    await notify({
      to: manager.id,
      message: `${participantId} has completed a training session in program ${programId}`
    })
  }
})
```
