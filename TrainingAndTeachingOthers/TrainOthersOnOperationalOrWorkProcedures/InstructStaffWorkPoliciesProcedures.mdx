## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { instructStaffWorkPoliciesProcedures } from '@headlessly/instruct-staff-work-policies-procedures'

const policies = instructStaffWorkPoliciesProcedures()

// Develop training materials for a new policy
const materials = await policies.developPolicyMaterials({
  policyId: 'POL-2026-018',
  title: 'Remote Work and Flexible Schedule Policy',
  sections: ['eligibility', 'expectations', 'equipment-guidelines', 'security-requirements']
})

// Schedule training for affected departments
const session = await policies.schedulePolicyTraining({
  materialId: materials.id,
  departments: ['engineering', 'marketing', 'operations'],
  scheduledDate: '2026-03-20',
  format: 'virtual-webinar'
})

// Audit compliance status
const audit = await policies.auditComplianceStatus({
  policyId: 'POL-2026-018',
  scope: 'organization-wide'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-schedule retraining when a policy is updated
policies.policyUpdateNotified(async ({ policyId, affectedDepartments }) => {
  await policies.schedulePolicyTraining({
    policyId,
    departments: affectedDepartments,
    scheduledDate: nextBusinessDay(),
    format: 'mandatory-briefing'
  })
})

// Escalate when comprehension assessment fails
policies.comprehensionAssessed(async ({ employeeId, passed, policyId }) => {
  if (!passed) {
    await notify({
      to: 'hr-compliance',
      message: `Employee ${employeeId} did not pass comprehension assessment for policy ${policyId}`
    })
  }
})
```
