## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { trainPersonnelManagerialTopics } from '@headlessly/train-personnel-managerial-topics'

const leadership = trainPersonnelManagerialTopics()

// Assess leadership readiness
const assessment = await leadership.assessLeadershipReadiness({
  participantId: 'EMP-5501',
  competencyModel: 'enterprise-leadership-v3',
  assessmentMethod: 'multi-rater-feedback'
})

// Design a management program
const program = await leadership.designManagementProgram({
  name: 'Emerging Leaders Accelerator',
  competencies: ['strategic-thinking', 'team-leadership', 'change-management', 'financial-acumen'],
  format: 'cohort-based',
  duration: { months: 6 }
})

// Assign executive coaching
await leadership.assignCoaching({

  coachId: 'COACH-012',
  focusAreas: ['delegation', 'conflict-resolution'],
  sessions: 12,
  cadence: 'biweekly'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Create development plans after assessment
leadership.assessmentCenterConducted(async ({ participantId, results }) => {
  const gaps = results.competencies.filter(c => c.score < c.target)
  if (gaps.length > 0) {
    await leadership.createDevelopmentPlan({
      participantId,
      gaps: gaps.map(g => ({ competency: g.name, currentScore: g.score, targetScore: g.target }))
    })
  }
})

// Report program impact to senior leadership
leadership.programImpactMeasured(async ({ programId, metrics }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'senior-executive-team',
    message: `Management program ${programId}: ${metrics.participantCount} graduated, avg competency improvement ${metrics.avgImprovement}%`
  })
})
```
