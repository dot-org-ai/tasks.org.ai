## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { trainStaffMembersSocialServices } from '@headlessly/train-staff-members-social-services'

const socialTraining = trainStaffMembersSocialServices()

// Assess staff competency
const assessment = await socialTraining.assessStaffCompetency({
  staffId: 'SSW-2201',
  competencyFramework: 'social-services-core-v2',
  areas: ['case-management', 'crisis-intervention', 'cultural-competency', 'trauma-informed-care']
})

// Facilitate a case simulation
const simulation = await socialTraining.facilitateCaseSimulation({
  scenario: 'Family-Crisis-Intake',
  participants: ['SSW-2201', 'SSW-2202'],
  supervisorId: 'SUP-105',
  duration: { minutes: 90 }
})

// Award continuing education credits
await socialTraining.awardContinuingEducation({
  staffId: 'SSW-2201',
  workshopId: 'WS-TIC-2026',
  credits: 6,
  category: 'Trauma-Informed Care'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Schedule additional supervision when simulation reveals gaps
socialTraining.caseSimulationFacilitated(async ({ participants, scores, threshold }) => {
  for (const participant of participants) {
    if (participant.score < threshold) {
      await socialTraining.supervisePractice({
        staffId: participant.id,
        focusAreas: participant.gaps,
        sessions: 4
      })
    }
  }
})

// Notify staff of licensure renewal requirements
socialTraining.continuingEducationAwarded(async ({ staffId, totalCredits, requiredCredits, renewalDate }) => {
  const remaining = requiredCredits - totalCredits
  if (remaining > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: staffId,
      message: `You need ${remaining} more CE credits before licensure renewal on ${renewalDate}`
    })
  }
})
```
