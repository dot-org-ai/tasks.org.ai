# Train Personnel Proper Operational Procedures

> Business-as-Code definition for training personnel on proper operational procedures. Models the structured process of documenting correct procedures, delivering hands-on instruction, verifying adherence, and maintaining certification records.

## Overview

Training personnel on proper operational procedures focuses on ensuring that employees understand and can correctly execute standard operating procedures for their roles. This definition exposes actions for procedure documentation alignment, practical training delivery, competency verification through demonstration, and ongoing recertification management. It emphasizes safety, consistency, and regulatory adherence in operational execution.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { trainPersonnelProperOperationalProcedures } from '@headlessly/train-personnel-proper-operational-procedures'

const training = trainPersonnelProperOperationalProcedures()

// Align training with current procedures
await training.alignProcedures({
  sopIds: ['SOP-MFG-101', 'SOP-MFG-102'],
  effectiveDate: '2026-03-01'
})

// Observe trainee performance
const observation = await training.observePerformance({
  traineeId: 'EMP-2201',
  procedureId: 'SOP-MFG-101',
  evaluatorId: 'TRN-005',
  checklist: ['PPE donned correctly', 'Machine startup sequence followed', 'Safety interlock verified']
})

// Certify competency
await training.certifyCompetency({
  traineeId: 'EMP-2201',
  procedureId: 'SOP-MFG-101',
  certifiedDate: '2026-03-15',
  validUntil: '2027-03-15'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on procedural deviations
training.deviationDocumented(async ({ traineeId, procedureId, severity }) => {
  if (severity === 'critical') {
    await notify({
      to: 'safety-team',
      message: `Critical procedural deviation by ${traineeId} on ${procedureId}. Immediate retraining required.`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-notify for recertification
training.recertificationScheduled(async ({ traineeId, procedureId, dueDate }) => {
  await scheduleReminder({
    date: daysBeforeDate(dueDate, 30),
    to: traineeId,
    message: `Your certification for ${procedureId} expires on ${dueDate}. Please schedule recertification.`
  })
})
```
