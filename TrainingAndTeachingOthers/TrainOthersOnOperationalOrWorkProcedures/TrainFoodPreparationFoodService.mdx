## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { trainFoodPreparationFoodService } from '@headlessly/train-food-preparation-food-service'

const foodTraining = trainFoodPreparationFoodService()

// Develop a kitchen training program
const program = await foodTraining.developFoodTrainingProgram({
  type: 'line-cook-onboarding',
  modules: ['knife-skills', 'station-setup', 'cooking-methods', 'plating-standards'],
  safetyModules: ['food-handling', 'allergen-awareness', 'fire-safety']
})

// Conduct food safety certification training
await foodTraining.conductFoodSafetyTraining({
  participantIds: ['staff-101', 'staff-102', 'staff-103'],
  topics: ['temperature-control', 'cross-contamination-prevention', 'personal-hygiene'],
  certificationLevel: 'servsafe-food-handler'
})

// Evaluate staff competency
const evaluation = await foodTraining.evaluateStaffCompetency({
  workerId: 'staff-101',
  programId: program.id,
  criteria: ['food-safety-compliance', 'preparation-accuracy', 'timing-efficiency']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-issue certification when safety training is passed
foodTraining.staffCompetencyEvaluated(async ({ workerId, passed, certificationLevel }) => {
  if (passed && certificationLevel) {
    await foodTraining.issueFoodSafetyCertification({
      workerId,
      type: certificationLevel,
      validUntil: '2028-03-01'
    })
  }
})

// Alert manager when certifications are about to expire
foodTraining.foodSafetyCertificationIssued(async ({ workerId, validUntil }) => {
  const expirationWarning = subtractDays(validUntil, 30)
  await scheduleReminder({
    date: expirationWarning,
    to: 'restaurant-manager',
    message: `Food safety certification for ${workerId} expires on ${validUntil}`
  })
})
```
