// Assess sales readiness for a new hire
const assessment = await sales.assessSalesReadiness({
  representativeId: 'REP-1042',
  areas: ['product-knowledge', 'objection-handling', 'discovery-skills', 'crm-proficiency']
})

// Deliver product training
await sales.deliverProductTraining({

  products: ['Enterprise Platform', 'Analytics Suite'],
  participants: ['REP-1042', 'REP-1043', 'REP-1044'],

sales.rolePlayCompleted(async ({ representativeId, scenarioId, score, threshold }) => {
  if (score < threshold) {
    await sales.assignSalesCoach({
      representativeId,
      focusAreas: ['objection-handling', 'closing-techniques'],
      sessions: 6
    })
  }
})

// Track revenue impact quarterly
sales.salesReadinessCertified(async ({ representativeId, certificationDate }) => {
  await scheduleTask({
    date: addDays(certificationDate, 90),
    action: async () => {
      await sales.trackRevenueImpact({
        representativeId,
        baselinePeriod: { start: subtractDays(certificationDate, 90), end: certificationDate },
        comparisonPeriod: { start: certificationDate, end: addDays(certificationDate, 90) }
