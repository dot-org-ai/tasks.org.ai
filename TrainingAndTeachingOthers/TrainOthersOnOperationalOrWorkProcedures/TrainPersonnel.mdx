## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { trainPersonnel } from '@headlessly/train-personnel'

const training = trainPersonnel()

// Assess training needs
const needs = await training.assessTrainingNeeds({
  department: 'Customer Support',
  period: 'Q2-2026',
  competencyFramework: 'customer-service-excellence'
})

// Design a training program
const program = await training.designProgram({
  name: 'Customer Escalation Handling',
  objectives: ['De-escalation techniques', 'Complaint resolution workflows', 'CRM system proficiency'],

  duration: { hours: 8 }
})

// Enroll participants
await training.enrollParticipants({
  programId: program.id,
  sessionId: 'SES-20260401',
  employeeIds: needs.priorityEmployees
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify managers of completion
training.completionCertified(async ({ traineeId, programId }) => {
  const manager = await getManager(traineeId)
  await notify({
    to: manager,
    message: `${traineeId} has completed training program ${programId}`
  })
})

// Auto-review programs after each cohort
training.effectivenessEvaluated(async ({ programId, averageScore, completionRate }) => {
  if (averageScore < 70 || completionRate < 0.85) {
    await training.reviewProgram({
      programId,
      reason: `Below threshold: score=${averageScore}, completion=${completionRate}`
    })
  }
})
```
