## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { trainEmployeesProperWorkProcedures } from '@headlessly/train-employees-proper-work-procedures'

const training = trainEmployeesProperWorkProcedures()

// Identify training requirements
const requirements = await training.identifyTrainingRequirements({
  department: 'Assembly',
  workInstructions: ['WI-ASM-001', 'WI-ASM-002', 'WI-ASM-003'],
  newHires: ['EMP-7701', 'EMP-7702']
})

// Conduct a training session
const session = await training.conductTrainingSession({
  workInstructionId: 'WI-ASM-001',
  format: 'on-the-job',
  trainerId: 'TRN-015',
  participants: ['EMP-7701', 'EMP-7702'],
  date: '2026-03-20'
})

// Issue qualification after assessment
await training.issueQualification({
  employeeId: 'EMP-7701',
  workInstructionId: 'WI-ASM-001',
  qualifiedDate: '2026-03-20',
  validUntil: '2027-03-20'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Initiate corrective action on failed assessment
training.competencyAssessed(async ({ employeeId, workInstructionId, passed, deficiencies }) => {
  if (!passed) {
    await training.initiateCorrectiveAction({
      employeeId,
      workInstructionId,
      deficiencies,
      targetCompletionDate: addDays(new Date(), 14)
    })
  }
})

// Notify before recertification expires
training.recertificationScheduled(async ({ employeeId, workInstructionId, dueDate }) => {
  await scheduleReminder({
    date: daysBeforeDate(dueDate, 30),
    to: employeeId,
    message: `Your qualification for ${workInstructionId} expires on ${dueDate}. Please schedule reassessment.`
  })
})
```
