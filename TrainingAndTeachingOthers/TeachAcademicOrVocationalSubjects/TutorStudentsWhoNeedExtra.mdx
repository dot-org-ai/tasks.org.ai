## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { tutorStudentsWhoNeedExtra } from '@headlessly/tutor-students-who-need-extra'

const tutoring = tutorStudentsWhoNeedExtra()

// Assess a student's academic needs
const assessment = await tutoring.assessStudentNeeds({
  studentId: 'stu-2048',
  subjects: ['algebra', 'geometry'],
  referredBy: 'teacher-jones'
})

// Create an individualized learning plan
const plan = await tutoring.createLearningPlan({
  studentId: assessment.studentId,
  goals: [
    { subject: 'algebra', target: 'Solve linear equations independently' },
    { subject: 'geometry', target: 'Apply area and perimeter formulas' }
  ],
  duration: { weeks: 8 }
})

// Assign a tutor and schedule the first session
await tutoring.assignTutor({ planId: plan.id, tutorId: 'tutor-314' })
await tutoring.scheduleSession({
  planId: plan.id,
  date: '2026-03-10',
  time: '15:00',
  duration: 60
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify parent when progress is recorded
tutoring.progressRecorded(async ({ studentId, subject, improvement }) => {
  const parent = await getParentContact(studentId)
  await notify({
    to: parent.email,
    message: `Your student showed ${improvement}% improvement in ${subject}`
  })
})

// Auto-adjust plan when goals are not being met
tutoring.sessionCompleted(async ({ planId, sessionResults }) => {
  if (sessionResults.progressScore < 0.4) {
    await tutoring.adjustLearningPlan({
      planId,
      reason: 'Insufficient progress after session',
      adjustments: ['Reduce topic scope', 'Add practice exercises']
    })
  }
})
```
