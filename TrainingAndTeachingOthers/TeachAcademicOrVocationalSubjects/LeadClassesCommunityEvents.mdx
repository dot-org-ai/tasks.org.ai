```typescript
import { leadClassesCommunityEvents } from '@headlessly/lead-classes-community-events'

const events = leadClassesCommunityEvents()

// Plan a community workshop
const event = await events.planEvent({
  title: 'Financial Literacy for Families',

// Send confirmation when a participant registers
events.participantRegistered(async ({ eventId, name, email }) => {
  const eventDetails = await events.findEvents({ id: eventId })
  await notify({
    to: email,
    message: `You are registered for ${eventDetails.title} on ${eventDetails.date}`
  })
})

// Trigger follow-up when feedback is collected
events.feedbackCollected(async ({ eventId, averageRating }) => {
  if (averageRating < 3.0) {
    await createImprovementTicket({
      eventId,
      reason: 'Below-average participant satisfaction rating'
    })
