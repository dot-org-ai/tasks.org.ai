# Instruct College Students Physical Life

> Business-as-Code definition for instructing college students in physical or life sciences. Models the delivery of lectures, laboratory sessions, and assessments across disciplines such as biology, chemistry, physics, and earth sciences.

## Overview

Instructing college students in physical or life sciences involves delivering theoretical lectures, supervising laboratory experiments, demonstrating scientific methods, and assessing student comprehension through exams and lab reports. This definition exposes actions for course delivery, lab management, and student evaluation, along with events for safety compliance and academic milestone tracking.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { instructCollegeStudentsPhysicalLife } from '@headlessly/instruct-college-students-physical-life'

const sciences = instructCollegeStudentsPhysicalLife()

// Design a biology course with lab component
const course = await sciences.designCurriculum({
  title: 'Molecular Biology',
  department: 'Biology',
  term: 'Spring 2026',
  lectureHours: 3,
  labHours: 3,
  objectives: [
    'Describe DNA replication and transcription',
    'Perform gel electrophoresis',
    'Analyze gene expression data'
  ]
})

// Conduct a lab session
await sciences.conductLabSession({
  courseId: course.id,
  week: 5,
  experiment: 'Gel Electrophoresis of DNA Fragments',
  safetyProtocols: ['ppe-required', 'chemical-handling'],
  equipmentNeeded: ['electrophoresis-apparatus', 'uv-transilluminator']
})

// Grade lab reports
await sciences.gradeSubmissions({
  courseId: course.id,
  assignmentType: 'labReport',
  rubric: { methodology: 30, results: 30, analysis: 25, formatting: 15 }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Verify safety compliance before every lab
sciences.labSessionConducted(async ({ courseId, labId, safetyStatus }) => {
  if (safetyStatus !== 'compliant') {
    await escalate({
      to: 'environmental-health-safety',
      message: `Lab ${labId} safety issue detected in course ${courseId}`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-notify students when grades are posted
sciences.submissionsGraded(async ({ courseId, assignmentTitle }) => {
  const roster = await getEnrolledStudents(courseId)
  await notifyAll({
    to: roster,
    message: `Grades for ${assignmentTitle} have been posted`
  })
})
```
