> Business-as-Code definition for reading to students. Models the process of selecting appropriate reading materials, delivering read-aloud sessions, engaging students through comprehension activities, and tracking literacy development outcomes.

## Overview

Reading to students involves selecting age-appropriate and curriculum-aligned texts, delivering read-aloud sessions that model fluency and expression, engaging learners through guided comprehension activities, and assessing the impact of reading sessions on vocabulary acquisition and literacy development. This definition exposes actions for curating reading materials, scheduling read-aloud sessions, facilitating interactive reading experiences, and documenting student comprehension and engagement.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { readStudents } from '@headlessly/read-students'

const reading = readStudents()

// Select reading material
const material = await reading.selectReadingMaterial({
  gradeLevel: 2,
  subject: 'language-arts',
  theme: 'community-helpers',
  readingLevel: 'guided-level-J'
})

// Schedule and deliver a read-aloud session
const session = await reading.scheduleReadAloudSession({
  materialId: material.id,
  classId: 'class-2b',
  scheduledDate: '2026-04-09',
  duration: { minutes: 30 }
})

await reading.deliverReadAloud({
  sessionId: session.id,
  focusSkills: ['vocabulary-in-context', 'prediction', 'character-analysis']
})

// Assess literacy progress
const assessment = await reading.assessLiteracyProgress({
  classId: 'class-2b',
  assessmentType: 'comprehension-check',
  materialId: material.id
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-recommend follow-up reading when students are below benchmark
reading.literacyProgressAssessed(async ({ studentId, belowBenchmark, readingLevel }) => {
  if (belowBenchmark) {
    await reading.recommendFollowUpReading({
      studentId,
      currentLevel: readingLevel,
      focusAreas: ['fluency', 'vocabulary-building']
    })
  }
})

// Notify parents of reading session outcomes
reading.sessionOutcomesLogged(async ({ sessionId, classId }) => {
  const logs = await reading.getSessionLogs({ sessionId })
  await notify({
    to: `parents-${classId}`,
    message: `Read-aloud session completed: "${logs.materialTitle}". Comprehension activities included.`
  })
})
```
