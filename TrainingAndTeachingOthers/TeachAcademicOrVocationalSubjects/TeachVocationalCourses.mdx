## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { teachVocationalCourses } from '@headlessly/teach-vocational-courses'

const vocational = teachVocationalCourses()

// Develop an automotive technology curriculum
const course = await vocational.developCurriculum({
  title: 'Automotive Engine Repair',
  tradeArea: 'Automotive Technology',
  term: 'Spring 2026',
  competencies: [
    'Diagnose engine mechanical problems',
    'Perform cylinder head repair',
    'Replace timing components'
  ],
  certificationPath: 'ASE Engine Repair'
})

// Conduct a shop session
await vocational.conductShopSession({
  courseId: course.id,
  week: 6,
  topic: 'Cylinder Head Removal and Inspection',
  equipmentRequired: ['engine hoist', 'torque wrench', 'dial indicator']
})

// Assess student competency
await vocational.assessCompetency({
  courseId: course.id,
  studentId: 'stu-4401',
  competency: 'Perform cylinder head repair',
  result: 'proficient'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify certification body when a student earns credentials
vocational.certificationEarned(async ({ studentId, certification }) => {
  await submitCertificationRecord({
    studentId,
    certification,
    dateEarned: new Date().toISOString()
  })
})

// Alert program director when competency pass rates drop
vocational.competencyAssessed(async ({ courseId, competency, result }) => {
  if (result === 'not-proficient') {
    const stats = await vocational.getStudentCompetencies({ courseId, competency })
    if (stats.passRate < 0.6) {
      await escalate({
        to: 'program-director',
        message: `Pass rate for "${competency}" is ${stats.passRate * 100}%`
      })
    }
  }
})
```
