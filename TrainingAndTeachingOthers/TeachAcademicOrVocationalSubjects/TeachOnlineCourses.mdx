## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { teachOnlineCourses } from '@headlessly/teach-online-courses'

const online = teachOnlineCourses()

// Design an online course
const course = await online.designOnlineCourse({
  title: 'Data Science Fundamentals',
  format: 'hybrid',
  modules: [
    { title: 'Introduction to Python', weeks: 2 },
    { title: 'Statistical Analysis', weeks: 3 },
    { title: 'Machine Learning Basics', weeks: 3 }
  ],
  platform: 'canvas'
})

// Publish a module's content
await online.publishContent({
  courseId: course.id,
  moduleIndex: 0,
  materials: [
    { type: 'video', title: 'Python Setup Walkthrough', url: '/videos/python-setup.mp4' },
    { type: 'reading', title: 'Python Basics', url: '/docs/python-basics.pdf' }
  ]
})

// Analyze student engagement mid-term
const analytics = await online.analyzeEngagement({
  courseId: course.id,
  period: 'weeks-1-4',
  metrics: ['loginFrequency', 'assignmentCompletion', 'forumParticipation']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert instructor when student engagement drops
online.engagementAnalyzed(async ({ courseId, atRiskStudents }) => {
  for (const student of atRiskStudents) {
    await notify({
      to: student.email,
      message: 'We noticed you have not logged in recently. Please reach out if you need support.'
    })
  }
})

// Auto-open discussion forums when content is published
online.contentPublished(async ({ courseId, moduleIndex }) => {
  await online.moderateDiscussion({
    courseId,
    moduleIndex,
    action: 'openForum',
    prompt: `Share your initial thoughts on this module's topic`
  })
})
```
