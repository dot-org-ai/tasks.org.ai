## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { teachSocialScienceCoursesCollege } from '@headlessly/teach-social-science-courses-college'

const courses = teachSocialScienceCoursesCollege()

// Design a new sociology course
const course = await courses.designCourse({
  title: 'Introduction to Sociology',
  department: 'Sociology',
  term: 'Fall 2026',
  credits: 3,
  objectives: [
    'Explain foundational sociological theories',
    'Analyze social institutions and inequality',
    'Conduct basic sociological research'
  ]
})

// Assign a research paper
await courses.assignCoursework({
  courseId: course.id,
  type: 'researchPaper',
  title: 'Social Stratification Analysis',
  dueDate: '2026-11-15',
  pointValue: 100
})

// Record final grades
await courses.recordGrades({
  courseId: course.id,
  grades: [
    { studentId: 'stu-1001', grade: 'A' },
    { studentId: 'stu-1002', grade: 'B+' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify students when coursework is assigned
courses.courseworkAssigned(async ({ courseId, assignmentTitle, dueDate }) => {
  const enrolled = await getEnrolledStudents(courseId)
  await notifyAll({
    to: enrolled,
    message: `New assignment: ${assignmentTitle} due ${dueDate}`
  })
})

// Trigger course improvement review when grades are finalized
courses.gradesRecorded(async ({ courseId, term }) => {
  const distribution = await courses.getGradeDistribution({ courseId, term })
  if (distribution.averageGpa < 2.5) {
    await courses.reviewCourseOutcomes({
      courseId,
      reason: 'Below-target grade distribution',
      distribution
    })
  }
})
```
