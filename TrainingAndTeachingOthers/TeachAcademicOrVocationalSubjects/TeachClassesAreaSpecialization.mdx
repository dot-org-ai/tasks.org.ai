## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { teachClassesAreaSpecialization } from '@headlessly/teach-classes-area-specialization'

const specialized = teachClassesAreaSpecialization()

// Design an advanced cybersecurity course
const course = await specialized.designSpecializedCourse({
  title: 'Advanced Network Penetration Testing',
  specialization: 'Cybersecurity',
  level: 'graduate',
  prerequisites: ['Network Security Fundamentals', 'Operating Systems'],
  objectives: [
    'Conduct vulnerability assessments on enterprise networks',
    'Develop and execute penetration testing methodologies',
    'Produce professional security audit reports'
  ]
})

// Assign a capstone project
await specialized.assignCapstoneProject({
  courseId: course.id,
  title: 'Enterprise Security Audit',
  description: 'Perform a full penetration test on a simulated corporate network',
  deliverables: ['vulnerability report', 'remediation plan', 'executive summary'],
  dueDate: '2026-12-01'
})

// Evaluate student mastery
await specialized.evaluateMastery({
  courseId: course.id,
  studentId: 'stu-7892',
  assessmentType: 'capstone',
  score: 92,
  feedback: 'Excellent methodology and thorough documentation'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Update professional association on course outcomes
specialized.masteryEvaluated(async ({ courseId, studentId, score }) => {
  if (score >= 90) {
    await submitProficiencyRecord({
      studentId,
      courseId,
      designation: 'distinction'
    })
  }
})

// Auto-trigger content updates when new research is published
specialized.courseContentUpdated(async ({ courseId, updatedTopics }) => {
  const enrolled = await getEnrolledStudents(courseId)
  await notifyAll({
    to: enrolled,
    message: `Course materials updated for topics: ${updatedTopics.join(', ')}`
  })
})
```
