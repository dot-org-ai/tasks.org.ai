### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { teachHumanitiesCoursesCollegeLevel } from '@headlessly/teach-humanities-courses-college-level'

const humanities = teachHumanitiesCoursesCollegeLevel()

// Design a philosophy syllabus
const syllabus = await humanities.designSyllabus({
  title: 'Ethics and Moral Philosophy',

  await notify({
    to: 'writing-center',
    message: `Students in course ${courseId} have a new essay "${title}" due ${dueDate}. Expect tutoring demand.`
  })
})

// Trigger course review when evaluations are low
humanities.courseEffectivenessAssessed(async ({ courseId, averageRating }) => {
  if (averageRating < 3.5) {
    await createReviewTicket({
      courseId,
      reason: 'Below-threshold student evaluation scores',
      averageRating
    })
  }
})
```
