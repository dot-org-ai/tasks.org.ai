## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { guideClassDiscussions } from '@headlessly/guide-class-discussions'

const discussions = guideClassDiscussions()

// Prepare a discussion plan
const plan = await discussions.prepareDiscussionPlan({
  courseId: 'HIST-301',
  topic: 'Industrial Revolution: Economic and Social Impact',
  prompts: [
    'How did mechanization reshape labor markets?',
    'What parallels exist between industrial and digital transformation?',
    'Evaluate the role of government regulation during rapid economic change.'
  ],
  learningObjectives: ['critical-analysis', 'historical-comparison', 'argumentation']
})

// Schedule and facilitate
const session = await discussions.scheduleDiscussionSession({
  planId: plan.id,
  scheduledDate: '2026-04-08',
  format: 'seminar-style',
  participantCount: 25
})

// Assess outcomes
const outcomes = await discussions.assessDiscussionOutcomes({
  sessionId: session.id,
  criteria: ['depth-of-analysis', 'evidence-use', 'peer-interaction']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-generate participation feedback after each session
discussions.discussionSummarized(async ({ sessionId }) => {
  const records = await discussions.getParticipationRecords({ sessionId })
  for (const record of records) {
    await discussions.provideParticipationFeedback({
      studentId: record.studentId,
      sessionId,
      engagementScore: record.score,
      notes: record.observations
    })
  }
})

// Flag low-engagement students for follow-up
discussions.participationMonitored(async ({ sessionId, lowEngagementStudents }) => {
  if (lowEngagementStudents.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'course-instructor',
      message: `${lowEngagementStudents.length} students had low engagement in session ${sessionId}`
    })
  }
})
```
