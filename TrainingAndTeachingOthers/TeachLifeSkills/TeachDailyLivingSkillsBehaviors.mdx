## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { teachDailyLivingSkillsBehaviors } from '@headlessly/teach-daily-living-skills-behaviors'

const instruction = teachDailyLivingSkillsBehaviors()

// Assess a new learner's daily living abilities
const assessment = await instruction.assessAbilities({
  learnerId: 'learner-4521',
  domains: ['personal-hygiene', 'meal-preparation', 'household-cleaning', 'money-management'],
  assessmentTool: 'adaptive-behavior-scale'
})

// Create an individualized learning plan
const plan = await instruction.createLearningPlan({
  learnerId: 'learner-4521',
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  goals: [
    { skill: 'prepare-simple-meals', targetDate: '2026-06-01' },
    { skill: 'manage-laundry-routine', targetDate: '2026-08-01' }
  ]
})

// Track progress after a session
await instruction.trackProgress({
  learnerId: 'learner-4521',
  sessionId: 'session-892',
  skill: 'prepare-simple-meals',
  promptLevel: 'verbal-cue-only',
  completionRate: 0.85
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify the care team when a learner achieves competency
instruction.competencyCertified(async ({ learnerId, skill }) => {
  await notify({
    to: ['case-manager', 'family-contact'],
    message: `Learner ${learnerId} has achieved independence in ${skill}`
  })
})

// Automatically adjust the plan when progress stalls
instruction.progressTracked(async ({ learnerId, completionRate, sessionCount }) => {
  if (completionRate < 0.4 && sessionCount > 5) {
    await instruction.adjustPlan({
      learnerId,
      reason: 'insufficient-progress',
      action: 'simplify-task-steps'
    })
  }
})
```
