## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { teachLifeSkills } from '@headlessly/teach-life-skills'

const program = teachLifeSkills()

// Enroll a new participant
const participant = await program.enrollParticipant({
  name: 'Jordan Rivera',
  cohortId: 'spring-2026',
  referralSource: 'county-social-services',
  targetSkills: ['financial-literacy', 'job-readiness', 'conflict-resolution']
})

// Assess skill gaps
const gaps = await program.assessSkillGaps({
  participantId: participant.id,
  domains: ['budgeting', 'resume-writing', 'interpersonal-communication']
})

// Evaluate competency after a lesson series
const evaluation = await program.evaluateCompetency({
  participantId: participant.id,
  skill: 'financial-literacy',
  rubricId: 'budgeting-rubric-v2',
  evidence: ['completed-budget-worksheet', 'savings-plan-presentation']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Automatically issue certificate when all competencies are met
program.competencyEvaluated(async ({ participantId, skill, mastery }) => {
  if (mastery) {
    const allComplete = await program.getCompetencyScores({
      participantId,
      filter: { mastery: false }
    })
    if (allComplete.length === 0) {
      await program.issueCertificate({ participantId })
    }
  }
})

// Alert social worker when a participant's gaps are assessed
program.skillGapsAssessed(async ({ participantId, gaps }) => {
  if (gaps.length > 4) {
    await notify({
      to: 'assigned-social-worker',
      message: `Participant ${participantId} has significant skill gaps across ${gaps.length} domains`
    })
  }
})
```
