## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { establishNursingPoliciesStandards } from '@headlessly/establish-nursing-policies-standards'

const nursingPolicies = establishNursingPoliciesStandards()

// Identify need for a fall prevention policy update
const need = await nursingPolicies.identifyPolicyNeed({
  trigger: 'incident-trend',
  description: 'Increase in patient falls on medical-surgical units over Q4',
  affectedUnits: ['med-surg-3a', 'med-surg-3b'],
  currentPolicyId: 'np-fall-prevention-2024'
})

// Review clinical evidence
const evidence = await nursingPolicies.reviewEvidence({
  topic: 'fall-prevention-interventions',
  sources: ['pubmed', 'cochrane-library', 'ana-guidelines'],
  dateRange: { start: '2023-01-01', end: '2026-01-31' }
})

// Draft the updated policy
const draft = await nursingPolicies.draftPolicy({
  title: 'Fall Prevention and Management Protocol',
  scope: 'All inpatient nursing units',
  procedures: [
    'Conduct fall risk assessment on admission using Morse Fall Scale',
    'Implement tiered interventions based on risk score',
    'Document fall events within 2 hours of occurrence'
  ],
  evidenceReviewId: evidence.id
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify nursing units when a policy is disseminated
nursingPolicies.policyDisseminated(async ({ policyId, title, affectedUnits }) => {
  for (const unit of affectedUnits) {
    await notify({
      to: `nurse-manager-${unit}`,
      message: `New policy effective: ${title}. Please review and update unit protocols.`
    })
  }
})

// Schedule compliance audit after policy approval
nursingPolicies.policyApproved(async ({ policyId, effectiveDate }) => {
  await scheduleTask({
    action: 'auditCompliance',
    policyId,
    scheduledDate: addDays(effectiveDate, 90),
    assignee: 'quality-improvement-nurse'
  })
})
```
