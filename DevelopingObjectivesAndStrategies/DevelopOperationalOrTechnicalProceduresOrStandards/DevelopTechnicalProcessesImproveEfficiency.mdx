# Develop Technical Processes Improve Efficiency

> Business-as-Code definition for developing technical processes to improve biofuel production efficiency. Models the lifecycle from feedstock analysis and process design through pilot testing, scale-up, and continuous optimization of conversion yields and energy balance.

## Overview

Developing technical processes to improve biofuel production efficiency involves researching, designing, and validating methods that increase conversion yields, reduce energy consumption, and lower production costs for biofuel operations. This activity spans feedstock evaluation, enzyme and catalyst selection, fermentation optimization, and downstream processing improvements. The resulting processes are tested at pilot scale, validated against performance targets, and scaled to commercial production with ongoing monitoring.

## Actors

| Actor | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| FeedstockSupplier | Providers of biomass, agricultural residues, or algae for biofuel production |
| EquipmentManufacturer | Vendors of reactors, fermentation vessels, and distillation systems |
| EnvironmentalAgency | Regulators overseeing emissions and waste from biofuel facilities |
| EnergyDepartment | Government agencies funding or regulating renewable energy programs |
| ResearchUniversity | Academic partners conducting fundamental biofuel research |

## Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| BiofuelProcessEngineer | Designs and optimizes conversion processes for biofuel production |
| FermentationScientist | Develops and monitors biological conversion pathways |
| PlantManager | Oversees scale-up and commercial production operations |
| SustainabilityAnalyst | Evaluates environmental impact and lifecycle energy balance |

## Entities

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ConversionProcess | A defined method for transforming feedstock into biofuel |
| FeedstockProfile | Characteristics of a biomass source including composition and yield potential |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { developTechnicalProcessesImproveEfficiency } from '@headlessly/develop-technical-processes-improve-efficiency'

const biofuel = developTechnicalProcessesImproveEfficiency()

// Analyze a new feedstock source
const feedstock = await biofuel.analyzeFeedstock({
  type: 'Corn Stover',
  region: 'Midwest US',
  composition: { cellulose: 37.5, hemicellulose: 22.4, lignin: 17.6 },
  moistureContent: 15.2
})

// Design and pilot a conversion process
const process = await biofuel.designConversionProcess({
  feedstockId: feedstock.id,
  method: 'Enzymatic Hydrolysis + Fermentation',
  targetYield: { ethanol: 85, unit: 'gallons-per-dry-ton' }
})

// Run pilot test and measure efficiency
const pilot = await biofuel.runPilotTest({
  processId: process.id,
  batchSize: { value: 500, unit: 'kg' },
  duration: { value: 72, unit: 'hours' }
})

const metrics = await biofuel.measureEfficiency({
  pilotRunId: pilot.id,
  measures: ['ethanolYield', 'energyBalance', 'waterUsage', 'costPerGallon']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert team when pilot results exceed targets
biofuel.efficiencyMeasured(async ({ processId, metrics }) => {
  if (metrics.ethanolYield > 80) {
    await notify({
      to: 'plant-managers',
      message: `Process ${processId} achieved ${metrics.ethanolYield} gal/dry-ton. Ready for scale-up review.`
    })
  }
})

// Schedule environmental review before scaling
biofuel.processScaled(async ({ processId, facility }) => {
  await createReview({
    type: 'Environmental Impact Assessment',
    processId,
    facility,
    reviewer: 'sustainability-analyst',
    deadline: addDays(new Date(), 60)
  })
})
```
