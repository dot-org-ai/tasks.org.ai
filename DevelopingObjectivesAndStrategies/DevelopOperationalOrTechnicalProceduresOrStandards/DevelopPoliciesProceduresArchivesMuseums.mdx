## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { developPoliciesProceduresArchivesMuseums } from '@headlessly/develop-policies-procedures-archives-museums'

const institutionalPolicies = developPoliciesProceduresArchivesMuseums()

// Assess needs for a digital preservation policy
const needs = await institutionalPolicies.assessInstitutionalNeeds({
  institutionId: 'city-historical-archive',
  areas: ['digital-preservation', 'born-digital-collections'],
  currentPolicies: ['collection-development-2022', 'physical-preservation-2023']
})

// Draft a digital preservation policy
const draft = await institutionalPolicies.draftPolicy({
  title: 'Digital Preservation and Access Policy',
  scope: 'All born-digital and digitized materials in the collection',
  sections: [
    { heading: 'File Format Standards', content: 'Preferred formats: TIFF for images, PDF/A for documents...' },
    { heading: 'Storage and Redundancy', content: 'Minimum three copies across geographically separated locations...' },
    { heading: 'Access and Rights', content: 'Digital materials shall be accessible via the online catalog...' },
    { heading: 'Migration Schedule', content: 'Format migration review every five years...' }
  ]
})

// Consult stakeholders
await institutionalPolicies.consultStakeholders({
  policyDraftId: draft.id,
  consultees: ['archival-staff', 'it-department', 'board-of-trustees', 'research-advisory-committee'],
  deadline: '2026-05-01'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify staff when a new policy is implemented
institutionalPolicies.policyImplemented(async ({ policyId, title, affectedDepartments }) => {
  for (const dept of affectedDepartments) {
    await notify({
      to: `${dept}-staff`,
      message: `New policy in effect: ${title}. Please review updated procedures.`
    })
  }
})

// Schedule periodic policy review
institutionalPolicies.policyApproved(async ({ policyId, title, effectiveDate }) => {
  await scheduleTask({
    action: 'reviewAndUpdatePolicy',
    policyId,
    scheduledDate: addYears(effectiveDate, 3),
    assignee: 'collections-manager'
  })
})
```
