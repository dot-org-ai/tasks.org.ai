# Draft Legislation Regulations

  topic: 'autonomous-vehicle-safety-standards',
  jurisdictions: ['US-Federal', 'US-CA'],
  existingLaws: ['motor-vehicle-safety-act', 'ca-av-testing-regulations']
})

// Create initial draft
const draft = await legislation.createDraft({

    title: `Review ${type}: ${title}`,
    draftId,
    priority: 'high'
  })
})
