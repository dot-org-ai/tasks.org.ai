## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { developOrganizationalPoliciesPrograms } from '@headlessly/develop-organizational-policies-programs'

const policies = developOrganizationalPoliciesPrograms()

// Draft a new remote work policy
const draft = await policies.draftPolicy({
  title: 'Remote Work Policy',
  scope: 'All full-time employees',
  department: 'Human Resources',
  effectiveDate: '2026-04-01',
  complianceRequirements: ['FLSA', 'State Labor Laws']
})

// Submit for stakeholder review
await policies.reviewPolicy({
  policyId: draft.id,
  reviewers: ['legal', 'hr-leadership', 'union-rep'],
  deadline: '2026-03-01'
})

// Design an implementation program
await policies.designProgram({
  name: 'Remote Work Enablement',
  policyId: draft.id,
  milestones: [
    { name: 'Manager Training', date: '2026-03-15' },
    { name: 'Employee Communication', date: '2026-03-25' },
    { name: 'Go-Live', date: '2026-04-01' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify compliance team when a policy is published
policies.policyPublished(async ({ policyId, title, effectiveDate }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'compliance-team',
    message: `Policy "${title}" is now effective as of ${effectiveDate}`
  })
})

// Trigger review when a regulatory change is detected
policies.policyNeedIdentified(async ({ reason, regulatoryBody }) => {
  await policies.draftPolicy({
    title: `Policy Update: ${reason}`,
    scope: 'Organization-wide',
    complianceRequirements: [regulatoryBody]
  })
})
```
