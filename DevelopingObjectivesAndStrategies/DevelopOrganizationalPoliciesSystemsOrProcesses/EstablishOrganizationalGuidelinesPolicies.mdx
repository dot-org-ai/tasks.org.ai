## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { establishOrganizationalGuidelinesPolicies } from '@headlessly/establish-organizational-guidelines-policies'

const guidelines = establishOrganizationalGuidelinesPolicies()

// Define a new data privacy guideline
const guideline = await guidelines.defineGuideline({
  title: 'Employee Data Privacy Standards',
  scope: 'All departments handling personal data',
  domain: 'Information Security',
  requirements: [
    'Encrypt personal data at rest and in transit',
    'Limit access to need-to-know personnel',
    'Conduct annual privacy training'
  ],
  effectiveDate: '2026-07-01'
})

// Submit for review and ratification
await guidelines.reviewGuideline({
  guidelineId: guideline.id,
  reviewers: ['legal', 'compliance', 'it-security'],
  deadline: '2026-05-15'
})

// Distribute to the organization
await guidelines.distributeGuideline({
  guidelineId: guideline.id,
  channels: ['email', 'intranet', 'employee-portal'],
  requireAcknowledgment: true
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Escalate when acknowledgment rates are low
guidelines.guidelineDistributed(async ({ guidelineId, title }) => {
  setTimeout(async () => {
    const status = await guidelines.getAcknowledgmentStatus({ guidelineId })
    if (status.completionRate < 0.80) {
      await notify({
        to: 'hr-leadership',
        message: `Only ${status.completionRate * 100}% acknowledged "${title}"`
      })
    }
  }, 14 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // 14 days
})

// Log enforcement actions on violations
guidelines.violationDetected(async ({ guidelineId, employeeId, severity }) => {
  await guidelines.enforceGuideline({
    guidelineId,
    employeeId,
    action: severity === 'critical' ? 'suspension' : 'written-warning'
  })
})
```
