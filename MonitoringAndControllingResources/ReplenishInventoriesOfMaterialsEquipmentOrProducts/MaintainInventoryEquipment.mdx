|------|-------------|
| AssetManager | Oversees equipment acquisition and lifecycle |
| MaintenanceCoordinator | Schedules and tracks equipment servicing |
| OperationsManager | Assigns equipment to projects and tasks |
| Technician | Performs equipment repairs and maintenance |

## Entities

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainInventoryEquipment } from '@headlessly/maintain-inventory-equipment'

const equipment = maintainInventoryEquipment()

// Register a new asset
const asset = await equipment.registerAsset({
  serialNumber: 'FRK-2024-001',
  type: 'forklift',
  manufacturer: 'Crown',
  model: 'RC5500',
  purchaseDate: '2024-01-15',
  purchasePrice: 35000,
  location: 'WH-EAST'
})

// Log equipment usage
await equipment.logUsage({
  assetId: asset.id,
  hours: 8.5,
  date: '2026-02-05',
  operatorId: 'OPR-042'
})

// Schedule preventive maintenance
await equipment.scheduleMaintenance({
  assetId: asset.id,
  type: 'preventive',
  serviceDate: '2026-02-20',
  tasks: ['oil-change', 'hydraulic-inspection', 'tire-check']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-schedule maintenance based on usage
equipment.usageLogged(async ({ assetId, totalHours }) => {
  const schedule = await getMaintenanceSchedule(assetId)
  if (totalHours >= schedule.nextServiceHours) {
    await equipment.scheduleMaintenance({
      assetId,
      type: 'preventive',
      reason: 'usage-interval-reached'
    })
  }
})

// Alert on high-value asset location changes
equipment.locationUpdated(async ({ assetId, newLocation, value }) => {
  if (value > 50000) {
    await notify({
      to: 'asset-manager',
      message: `High-value asset ${assetId} moved to ${newLocation}`
    })
  }
})
```
