## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainInventoryMedicalSuppliesEquipment } from '@headlessly/maintain-inventory-medical-supplies-equipment'

const medical = maintainInventoryMedicalSuppliesEquipment()

// Track controlled substance dispensing
await medical.recordControlledDispensing({
  substanceId: 'DRUG-MORPH-10MG',
  quantity: 2,
  patientId: 'PAT-20260205-001',
  prescriberId: 'DR-SMITH',
  dispensedBy: 'NURSE-JONES',
  timestamp: '2026-02-05T14:30:00Z'
})

// Check for expiring supplies
const expiring = await medical.checkExpiration({
  withinDays: 30,
  category: 'sterile-supplies'
})

// Calibrate diagnostic equipment
await medical.calibrateEquipment({
  equipmentId: 'XRAY-ER-01',
  calibrationDate: '2026-02-05',
  technicianId: 'BIOMED-003',
  results: 'within-tolerance'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-order critical supplies
medical.criticalStockLow(async ({ supplyId, currentLevel, minimumLevel }) => {
  await purchaseOrder({
    items: [{ supplyId, quantity: minimumLevel * 2 }],
    priority: 'urgent'
  })
})

// Alert on product recalls
medical.recallIssued(async ({ lotNumbers, reason }) => {
  const affectedItems = await medical.getRecallItems({ lotNumbers })
  await notify({
    to: 'pharmacy-staff',
    message: `URGENT: ${affectedItems.length} items affected by recall - quarantine immediately`
  })
  for (const item of affectedItems) {
    await medical.quarantineRecall({ itemId: item.id })
  }
})
```
