| SupplyVendor | Provides consumable operational materials |
| EquipmentDealer | Supplies tools and reusable equipment |
| Warehouse | Stores and distributes supplies to locations |
| Shipper | Transports supplies between facilities |
| Technician | Uses supplies and equipment for work |
| FinanceTeam | Tracks supply costs and budgets |

## Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| SupplyManager | Oversees inventory levels and procurement |
| StockroomClerk | Manages receiving and distribution |
| FieldSupervisor | Requests supplies for work crews |
| ProcurementAgent | Negotiates vendor contracts and pricing |

## Entities

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| SupplyItem | A consumable operational material |
| EquipmentItem | A reusable tool or device |
| StockLocation | A storage facility or vehicle inventory |
| UsageRecord | Documentation of supply consumption |
| ReplenishmentOrder | A purchase order to restore stock |
| StandardizationPolicy | Rules for approved items and vendors |

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| trackStock | Monitor current inventory levels by location |
| recordConsumption | Log usage of supplies and equipment |
| transferInventory | Move items between locations |
| generateReplenishment | Create purchase orders for depleted stock |
| standardizeItems | Define approved supplies for consistent use |
| analyzeUsage | Review consumption patterns and costs |
| consolidateVendors | Reduce number of suppliers for efficiency |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| stockTracked | Inventory levels have been updated |
| consumptionRecorded | Supplies have been used and logged |
| inventoryTransferred | Items have moved between locations |
| replenishmentGenerated | Purchase order has been created |
| itemsStandardized | Approved supply list has been updated |
| usageAnalyzed | Consumption report has been produced |
| vendorsConsolidated | Supplier list has been rationalized |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainSupplyEquipmentInventories } from '@headlessly/maintain-supply-equipment-inventories'

const supplies = maintainSupplyEquipmentInventories()

// Track current stock levels
const stock = await supplies.trackStock({
  locationId: 'FAC-NORTH',
  category: 'maintenance-supplies'
})

// Record consumption by work crew
await supplies.recordConsumption({
  items: [
    { itemId: 'SUPPLY-GREASE-001', quantity: 2, unit: 'tubes' },
    { itemId: 'SUPPLY-FILTER-AIR', quantity: 10, unit: 'each' }
  ],
  consumedBy: 'CREW-05',
  workOrder: 'WO-20260205-042'
})

// Generate replenishment order
await supplies.generateReplenishment({
  locationId: 'FAC-NORTH',
  items: ['SUPPLY-GREASE-001', 'SUPPLY-FILTER-AIR'],
  deliveryDate: '2026-02-12'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-reorder low stock items
supplies.stockTracked(async ({ locationId, items }) => {
  const lowStock = items.filter(item => item.quantity <= item.reorderPoint)
  if (lowStock.length > 0) {
    await supplies.generateReplenishment({
      locationId,
      items: lowStock.map(item => item.id)
    })
  }
})

// Alert on unusual consumption patterns
supplies.usageAnalyzed(async ({ locationId, anomalies }) => {
  if (anomalies.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'supply-manager',
      message: `Unusual consumption at ${locationId}: ${anomalies.length} items exceed normal usage`
    })
  }
})
```
