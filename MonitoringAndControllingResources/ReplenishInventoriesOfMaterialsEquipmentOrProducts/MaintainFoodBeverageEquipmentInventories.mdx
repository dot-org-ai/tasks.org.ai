### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainFoodBeverageEquipmentInventories } from '@headlessly/maintain-food-beverage-equipment-inventories'

const inventory = maintainFoodBeverageEquipmentInventories()

// Record a delivery of fresh produce
await inventory.recordReceipt({
  deliveryId: 'DLV-20260205-001',
  items: [
    { sku: 'PRODUCE-LETTUCE', quantity: 20, unit: 'heads', expires: '2026-02-12' },
    { sku: 'PRODUCE-TOMATO', quantity: 15, unit: 'pounds', expires: '2026-02-10' }
  ]
})

// Check for items nearing expiration
const expiring = await inventory.checkExpiration({
  withinDays: 3
})

// Schedule maintenance for refrigeration equipment
await inventory.scheduleEquipmentMaintenance({
  equipmentId: 'REFRIG-WALK-IN-01',
  maintenanceDate: '2026-02-15',
  type: 'preventive'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-reorder when stock is low
inventory.stockUpdated(async ({ itemId, quantity, reorderPoint }) => {
  if (quantity <= reorderPoint) {
    await inventory.triggerReorder({ itemId })
  }
})

// Alert kitchen staff on expiring items
inventory.expirationApproaching(async ({ items }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'kitchen-staff',
    message: `${items.length} items expiring in next 2 days - prioritize use`
  })
})
```
