### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { distributeIncomingMail } from '@headlessly/distribute-incoming-mail'

const mailroom = distributeIncomingMail()

// Receive a morning delivery batch
const batch = await mailroom.receiveMail({
  carrier: 'usps',
  deliveryTime: '2026-03-10T09:15:00Z',
  itemCount: 47,
  trackedItems: 3
})

// Sort mail into department bins
await mailroom.sortMail({

    { itemId: 'mail-001', destination: 'dept-finance', floor: 3 },
    { itemId: 'mail-002', destination: 'dept-legal', floor: 5 },
    { itemId: 'pkg-003', destination: 'emp-david-park', floor: 2, tracked: true }
  ]
})

// Scan tracked package and confirm delivery
await mailroom.scanTrackedItems({
  batchId: batch.id,
  items: [{ itemId: 'pkg-003', trackingNumber: '9400111899223100047' }]
})

await mailroom.confirmDelivery({
  itemId: 'pkg-003',
  recipientId: 'emp-david-park',

// Notify recipients when tracked packages arrive
mailroom.trackedItemScanned(async ({ itemId, recipientId, trackingNumber }) => {
  await notify({
    to: recipientId,
    message: `Package ${trackingNumber} has arrived at the mailroom and is ready for delivery`
  })
})

// Alert mailroom supervisor for undeliverable items
mailroom.returnProcessed(async ({ itemId, reason, sender }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'mailroom-supervisor',
    message: `Undeliverable item ${itemId} from ${sender} - reason: ${reason}`
  })
