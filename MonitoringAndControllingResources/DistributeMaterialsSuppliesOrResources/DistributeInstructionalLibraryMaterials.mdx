## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { distributeInstructionalLibraryMaterials } from '@headlessly/distribute-instructional-library-materials'

const circulation = distributeInstructionalLibraryMaterials()

// Checkout material to patron
const checkout = await circulation.checkoutMaterial({
  materialId: 'BOOK-2024-1547',
  patronId: 'P-89432',
  dueDate: '2026-03-15',
  loanPeriod: '21 days'
})

// Place reservation on unavailable material
const reservation = await circulation.reserveMaterial({
  materialId: 'BOOK-2024-1547',
  patronId: 'P-90214',
  notificationPreference: 'email'
})

// Create course reserve for instructor
const courseReserve = await circulation.createCourseReserve({
  courseId: 'ECON-301',
  instructorId: 'I-4523',
  materials: [
    { id: 'BOOK-2024-8821', loanPeriod: '2 hours' },
    { id: 'JOURNAL-2025-445', loanPeriod: '24 hours' }
  ],
  semester: 'Spring 2026'
})

// Process material return
await circulation.returnMaterial({
  checkoutId: checkout.id,
  condition: 'good',
  returnDate: '2026-03-10'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-notify patron when reserved material becomes available
circulation.reservationFulfilled(async ({ reservationId, materialId, patronId }) => {
  const patron = await getPatron(patronId)

  await notify({
    to: patron.email,
    subject: 'Library Hold Ready for Pickup',
    body: `Your reserved material is now available. Please pick up within 7 days.`
  })
})

// Send overdue notices
circulation.materialCheckedOut(async ({ checkoutId, dueDate }) => {
  const reminderDate = new Date(dueDate)
  reminderDate.setDate(reminderDate.getDate() - 3)

  await scheduleNotification({
    date: reminderDate,
    action: 'sendDueReminder',
    checkoutId
  })
})
```
