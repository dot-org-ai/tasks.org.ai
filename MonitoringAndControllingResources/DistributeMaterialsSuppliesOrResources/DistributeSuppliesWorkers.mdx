## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { distributeSuppliesWorkers } from '@headlessly/distribute-supplies-workers'

const supplies = distributeSuppliesWorkers()

// Worker requests supplies for job
const requisition = await supplies.requestSupplies({
  workerId: 'W-4521',
  jobSite: 'Construction Site Alpha',
  items: [
    { supplyId: 'PPE-GLOVE-L', quantity: 10, urgency: 'routine' },
    { supplyId: 'TOOL-DRILL-BIT-5MM', quantity: 5, urgency: 'immediate' },
    { supplyId: 'SUPPLY-FASTENER-M8', quantity: 200, urgency: 'routine' }
  ],
  deliveryLocation: 'Site Office Trailer',
  requestedDate: '2026-02-08'
})

// Supervisor approves requisition
await supplies.approveRequisition({
  requisitionId: requisition.id,
  approverId: 'S-823',
  comments: 'Approved for Phase 2 installation work'
})

// Allocate and distribute supplies
const allocation = await supplies.allocateStock({
  requisitionId: requisition.id,
  warehouseId: 'WH-02',
  allocationDate: '2026-02-07'
})

await supplies.distributeSupplies({
  allocationId: allocation.id,
  deliveryMethod: 'site_delivery',
  estimatedDelivery: '2026-02-08T09:00:00'
})

// Record usage after distribution
await supplies.recordUsage({
  workerId: 'W-4521',
  items: [
    { supplyId: 'PPE-GLOVE-L', quantityUsed: 2, date: '2026-02-08' },
    { supplyId: 'TOOL-DRILL-BIT-5MM', quantityUsed: 1, date: '2026-02-08' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-trigger replenishment when stock is low
supplies.stockLevelsMonitored(async ({ locationId, items }) => {
  for (const item of items) {
    if (item.currentStock <= item.reorderPoint) {
      await supplies.triggerReplenishment({
        supplyId: item.id,
        locationId,
        reorderQuantity: item.standardOrderSize,
        priority: item.currentStock === 0 ? 'urgent' : 'routine'
      })
    }
  }
})

// Notify worker when supplies are ready for pickup
supplies.suppliesDistributed(async ({ allocationId, workerId, deliveryLocation }) => {
  const worker = await getWorker(workerId)

  await notify({
    to: worker.phone,
    type: 'sms',
    message: `Your supplies are ready for pickup at ${deliveryLocation}`
  })
})
```
