## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { acquireSuppliesEquipment } from '@headlessly/acquire-supplies-equipment'

const procurement = acquireSuppliesEquipment()

// Create requisition for office supplies
const req = await procurement.createRequisition({
  department: 'Marketing',
  items: [
    { name: 'Toner Cartridge XYZ', quantity: 10 },
    { name: 'Copy Paper A4', quantity: 50 }
  ],
  budget: 1500,
  priority: 'normal'
})

// Evaluate vendors for best pricing
const evaluation = await procurement.evaluateVendors({
  requisitionId: req.id,
  criteria: ['price', 'delivery-time', 'quality']
})

// Issue purchase order to selected vendor
await procurement.issuePurchaseOrder({
  requisitionId: req.id,
  vendorId: 'VEN-123',
  deliveryDate: '2026-02-20'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-approve small purchases
procurement.requisitionCreated(async ({ requisitionId, totalCost }) => {
  if (totalCost < 500) {
    await procurement.issuePurchaseOrder({
      requisitionId,
      autoApproved: true
    })
  }
})

// Alert on delivery delays
procurement.shipmentTracked(async ({ orderId, expectedDate, currentStatus }) => {
  const delay = calculateDelay(expectedDate, currentStatus)
  if (delay > 3) {
    await notify({
      to: 'procurement-team',
      message: `Order ${orderId} delayed by ${delay} days`
    })
  }
})
```
