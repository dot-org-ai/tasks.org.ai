## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { orderInstructionalLibraryMaterialsEquipment } from '@headlessly/order-instructional-library-materials-equipment'

const library = orderInstructionalLibraryMaterialsEquipment()

// Select new titles for collection
const selection = await library.selectMaterial({
  department: 'Computer Science',
  budget: 5000,
  criteria: ['recent publications', 'faculty requests', 'course reserves']
})

// Order books from vendor
await library.orderResource({
  vendorId: 'VEN-456',
  items: [
    { isbn: '978-0-13-468599-1', title: 'Clean Architecture', quantity: 3 },
    { isbn: '978-0-13-464955-0', title: 'Refactoring', quantity: 2 }
  ]
})

// Subscribe to academic database
await library.subscribeDatabase({
  database: 'IEEE Xplore Digital Library',
  term: 'Annual',
  users: 5000,
  startDate: '2026-03-01'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-catalog standard items
library.itemsReceived(async ({ orderId, items }) => {
  const standardItems = items.filter(i => i.isbn && i.catalogingSource === 'LC')
  for (const item of standardItems) {
    await library.catalogResource({
      item: item.id,
      source: 'Library of Congress',
      classification: 'auto'
    })
  }
})

// Alert on budget utilization
library.resourceOrdered(async ({ departmentBudget, totalSpent }) => {
  const utilization = totalSpent / departmentBudget
  if (utilization > 0.8) {
    await notify({
      to: 'acquisitions-team',
      message: `Department budget ${utilization * 100}% utilized`
    })
  }
})
```
