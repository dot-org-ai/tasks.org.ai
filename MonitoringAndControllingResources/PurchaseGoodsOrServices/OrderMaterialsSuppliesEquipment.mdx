## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { orderMaterialsSuppliesEquipment } from '@headlessly/order-materials-supplies-equipment'

const procurement = orderMaterialsSuppliesEquipment()

// Create requisition for office supplies
const req = await procurement.createRequisition({
  department: 'Operations',
  items: [
    { sku: 'PEN-001', description: 'Blue Pens', quantity: 100 },
    { sku: 'PAPER-A4', description: 'Copy Paper', quantity: 20 }
  ],
  estimatedCost: 450,
  priority: 'normal'
})

// Submit for manager approval
await procurement.submitApproval({
  requisitionId: req.id,
  approverId: 'MGR-123'
})

// Place order with preferred vendor
await procurement.placePurchaseOrder({
  requisitionId: req.id,
  vendorId: 'VEN-456',
  deliveryDate: '2026-02-18'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-approve small purchases
procurement.approvalSubmitted(async ({ requisitionId, estimatedCost }) => {
  if (estimatedCost < 500) {
    await procurement.approvePurchase({
      requisitionId,
      autoApproved: true,
      reason: 'Below approval threshold'
    })
  }
})

// Update inventory on receipt
procurement.goodsReceived(async ({ purchaseOrderId, items }) => {
  for (const item of items) {
    await updateInventory({
      sku: item.sku,
      quantityAdded: item.quantity,
      location: item.receivingLocation
    })
  }
})
```
