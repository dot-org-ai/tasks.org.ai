## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { orderConstructionExtractionMaterialsEquipment } from '@headlessly/order-construction-extraction-materials-equipment'

const construction = orderConstructionExtractionMaterialsEquipment()

// Estimate concrete for foundation pour
const estimate = await construction.estimateMaterials({
  projectId: 'PROJ-456',
  phase: 'Foundation',
  materials: [
    { type: 'Concrete 3000 PSI', area: 5000, thickness: 6 }
  ]
})

// Order ready-mix concrete
await construction.orderMaterials({
  supplierId: 'SUP-789',
  materials: [
    { type: 'Concrete 3000 PSI', quantity: 85, unit: 'cubic yards' }
  ],
  deliveryDate: '2026-02-15'
})

// Rent excavator for site work
await construction.rentEquipment({
  equipmentType: 'Hydraulic Excavator 320',
  startDate: '2026-02-10',
  duration: 14,
  deliveryLocation: 'Site A, 123 Construction Rd'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert foreman when delivery is imminent
construction.shipmentTracked(async ({ orderId, eta, jobSite }) => {
  if (eta < 60) { // minutes
    await notify({
      to: 'site-foreman',
      message: `Material delivery arriving in ${eta} minutes at ${jobSite}`
    })
  }
})

// Schedule return when rental period ending
construction.equipmentRented(async ({ rentalId, endDate }) => {
  const reminder = addDays(endDate, -2)
  await scheduleNotification({
    date: reminder,
    message: `Equipment rental ${rentalId} ends in 2 days. Arrange pickup.`
  })
})
```
