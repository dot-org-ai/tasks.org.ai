### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { purchaseProductsServices } from '@headlessly/purchase-products-services'

const purchasing = purchaseProductsServices()

// Create purchase request
const request = await purchasing.createRequest({
  category: 'IT Services',
  description: 'Cloud infrastructure consulting',
  estimatedCost: 25000,
  department: 'Engineering',
  urgency: 'normal'
})

// Select vendor from approved list
await purchasing.selectVendor({
  requestId: request.id,
  vendorId: 'VEN-789',
  rationale: 'Preferred vendor with existing MSA'
})

// Place order after approval
await purchasing.placeOrder({
  requestId: request.id,
  startDate: '2026-03-01',
  duration: '3 months',
  deliverables: ['Architecture assessment', 'Migration plan']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Route high-value purchases for executive approval
purchasing.requestCreated(async ({ requestId, estimatedCost }) => {
  if (estimatedCost > 50000) {
    await purchasing.approvePurchase({
      requestId,
      requiredApprovers: ['CFO', 'COO']
    })
  }
})

// Track spend against budget
purchasing.invoiceProcessed(async ({ category, amount }) => {
  const budget = await getBudget(category)
  const spent = budget.totalSpent + amount

  if (spent / budget.allocated > 0.9) {
    await notify({
      to: 'category-lead',
      message: `${category} budget 90% utilized`
    })
  }
})
```
