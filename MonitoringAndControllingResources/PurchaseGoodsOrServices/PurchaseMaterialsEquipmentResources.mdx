> Business-as-Code definition for strategic sourcing and capital expenditure management. Models RFP processes, vendor evaluation, and total cost of ownership analysis.

## Overview

Purchasing materials, equipment, and resources involves strategic sourcing decisions, competitive bidding, contract negotiation, and lifecycle cost analysis.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { purchaseMaterialsEquipmentResources } from '@headlessly/purchase-materials-equipment-resources'

const sourcing = purchaseMaterialsEquipmentResources()

// Issue RFP for manufacturing equipment
const rfp = await sourcing.createRFP({
  category: 'CNC Machining Center',
  specifications: {
    axes: 5,
    tolerance: '0.001 inch',
    toolChanger: 'Automatic 40-tool'
  },
  budget: 500000,
  responseDeadline: '2026-03-15'
})

// Evaluate submitted bids
const evaluation = await sourcing.evaluateBids({
  rfpId: rfp.id,
  criteria: [
    { name: 'Price', weight: 0.4 },
    { name: 'Delivery Time', weight: 0.2 },
    { name: 'Warranty', weight: 0.2 },
    { name: 'Service Network', weight: 0.2 }
  ]
})

// Negotiate with top-ranked vendor
await sourcing.negotiateTerms({
  rfpId: rfp.id,
  vendorId: evaluation.topVendor,
  counterOffer: {
    price: 475000,
    deliveryWeeks: 12,
    warrantyYears: 3
  }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Calculate TCO when bids received
sourcing.bidsReceived(async ({ rfpId, bids }) => {
  for (const bid of bids) {
    const tco = await sourcing.analyzeTCO({
      purchasePrice: bid.price,
      installationCost: bid.installation,
      annualMaintenance: bid.maintenanceContract,
      energyCost: estimateEnergyCost(bid.specifications),
      usefulLife: 10
    })
    bid.totalCost = tco
  }
})

// Alert on poor vendor performance
sourcing.performanceTracked(async ({ vendorId, metrics }) => {
  if (metrics.onTimeDelivery < 0.85 || metrics.qualityScore < 3.5) {
    await notify({
      to: 'category-manager',
      message: `Vendor ${vendorId} performance below threshold. Consider alternative sourcing.`
    })
  }
})
```
