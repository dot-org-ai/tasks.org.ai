### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { orderMedicalSuppliesEquipment } from '@headlessly/order-medical-supplies-equipment'

const medical = orderMedicalSuppliesEquipment()

// Check inventory for surgical supplies
const inventory = await medical.checkInventory({
  department: 'Operating Room',
  categories: ['Sutures', 'Gloves', 'Drapes']
})

// Create order for low stock items
const order = await medical.createOrder({
  items: [
    { sku: 'SUT-001', description: 'Absorbable Suture 3-0', quantity: 500 },
    { sku: 'GLV-002', description: 'Sterile Gloves Size 7', quantity: 1000 }

// Auto-reorder critical supplies
medical.inventoryChecked(async ({ item, currentLevel, reorderPoint }) => {
  if (currentLevel < reorderPoint && item.category === 'critical') {
    await medical.createOrder({
      items: [{ sku: item.sku, quantity: item.parLevel }],
      priority: 'urgent'
    })
  }
})

// Alert on recalled lot numbers
medical.suppliesReceived(async ({ items }) => {
  for (const item of items) {
    const recall = await checkRecallDatabase(item.lotNumber)
    if (recall) {
      await alert({
        severity: 'critical',
        message: `Recalled lot ${item.lotNumber} received. Quarantine immediately.`
