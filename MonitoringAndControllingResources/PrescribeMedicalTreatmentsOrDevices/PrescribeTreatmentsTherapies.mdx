## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { prescribeTreatmentsTherapies } from '@headlessly/prescribe-treatments-therapies'

const treatments = prescribeTreatmentsTherapies()

// Create physical therapy order
const treatment = await treatments.createTreatment({
  patientId: 'PAT-789',
  diagnosis: 'Total knee replacement',
  clinicalIndication: 'Post-operative rehabilitation'
})

// Select therapy modality and frequency
await treatments.selectTherapy({
  treatmentId: treatment.id,
  modality: 'Physical Therapy',
  frequency: '3 times per week',
  duration: '6 weeks',
  goals: [
    'Increase knee flexion to 120 degrees',
    'Independent ambulation without assistive device',
    'Return to work activities'
  ]
})

// Request insurance authorization
await treatments.requestAuthorization({
  treatmentId: treatment.id,
  sessionsRequested: 18,
  payerId: 'INS-456'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Schedule initial evaluation when authorized
treatments.authorizationApproved(async ({ treatmentId, patientId }) => {
  await treatments.scheduleSession({
    treatmentId,
    sessionType: 'Initial Evaluation',
    duration: 60,
    priority: 'high'
  })
})

// Alert provider when goals achieved
treatments.progressTracked(async ({ treatmentId, outcomes }) => {
  const goalsAchieved = outcomes.filter(o => o.status === 'met').length
  const totalGoals = outcomes.length

  if (goalsAchieved === totalGoals) {
    await notify({
      to: 'prescribing-provider',
      message: `All therapy goals achieved for treatment ${treatmentId}. Consider discharge.`
    })
  }
})
```
