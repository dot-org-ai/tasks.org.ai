## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { prescribeAssistiveMedicalDevicesRelated } from '@headlessly/prescribe-assistive-medical-devices-related'

const devices = prescribeAssistiveMedicalDevicesRelated()

// Assess patient need for mobility aid
const assessment = await devices.assessNeed({
  patientId: 'PAT-456',
  functionalLimitation: 'Difficulty ambulating > 50 feet',
  goals: 'Independent mobility within home and community'
})

// Prescribe power wheelchair
const prescription = await devices.prescribeDevice({
  patientId: 'PAT-456',
  deviceType: 'Power Wheelchair',
  specifications: {
    seatWidth: '18 inches',
    weightCapacity: '300 lbs',
    features: ['Tilt-in-space', 'Elevating legrests']
  }
})

// Request insurance authorization
await devices.requestAuthorization({
  prescriptionId: prescription.id,
  diagnosis: 'Multiple sclerosis with mobility impairment',
  clinicalJustification: 'Patient unable to safely use manual wheelchair',
  payerId: 'INS-789'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Schedule fitting when authorization approved
devices.authorizationApproved(async ({ prescriptionId, patientId }) => {
  await devices.scheduleFitting({
    prescriptionId,
    patientId,
    appointmentType: 'Device fitting and training',
    duration: 90
  })
})

// Coordinate home setup for complex devices
devices.deviceDelivered(async ({ prescriptionId, deviceType }) => {
  const complexDevices = ['Hospital Bed', 'Hoyer Lift', 'CPAP Machine']
  if (complexDevices.includes(deviceType)) {
    await scheduleHomeHealth({
      prescriptionId,
      service: 'Device setup and patient training',
      priority: 'high'
    })
  }
})
```
