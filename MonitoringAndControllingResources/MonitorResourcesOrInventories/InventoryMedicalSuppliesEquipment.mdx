# Inventory Medical Supplies Equipment

> Business-as-Code definition for medical supplies and equipment inventory management. Models tracking, counting, and compliance monitoring of healthcare materials and devices.

## Overview

Medical supplies and equipment inventory management involves tracking usage, conducting physical counts, and ensuring regulatory compliance for healthcare materials and devices. This definition exposes actions for expiration monitoring, sterility tracking, and recall management across clinical and storage locations.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { inventoryMedicalSuppliesEquipment } from '@headlessly/inventory-medical-supplies-equipment'

const medicalInventory = inventoryMedicalSuppliesEquipment()

// Track supply usage during procedure
await medicalInventory.trackSupplyUsage({
  procedureId: 'PROC-2026-4521',
  patientId: 'P-89234',
  department: 'Surgery',
  supplies: [
    { itemId: 'SUTURE-4-0-SILK', lotNumber: 'L2025-4482', quantity: 3 },
    { itemId: 'SURGICAL-GLOVE-M', lotNumber: 'L2025-9034', quantity: 4 },
    { itemId: 'GAUZE-4X4-STERILE', lotNumber: 'L2026-1145', quantity: 20 }
  ],
  usageDate: '2026-02-11'
})

// Conduct periodic count of high-value supplies
const count = await medicalInventory.conductPhysicalCount({
  location: 'Operating Room Supply Closet 3',
  countType: 'high_value',
  items: ['IMPLANT-HIP-TITANIUM', 'CARDIAC-STENT-DRUG-ELUTE'],
  countDate: '2026-02-12'
})

// Monitor expiring supplies
const expiringItems = await medicalInventory.monitorExpirations({
  locations: ['Pharmacy', 'Emergency Department', 'ICU Supply'],
  daysUntilExpiration: 30
})

// Track equipment sterilization
await medicalInventory.trackSterilization({
  equipmentId: 'SURGICAL-INSTRUMENT-SET-12',
  sterilizationCycle: 'CYCLE-2026-02-11-08',
  method: 'autoclave',
  temperature: 134,
  duration: 18,
  operator: 'SPD-04',
  verificationDate: '2026-02-11T09:30:00'
})

// Process recall notice
await medicalInventory.processRecall({
  recallNotice: 'FDA-2026-RC-8834',
  affectedProduct: 'IV Tubing Set Model XR-500',
  lotNumbers: ['L2025-8821', 'L2025-8822', 'L2025-8823'],
  action: 'quarantine_and_return',
  urgency: 'immediate'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-rotate expiring supplies to high-visibility locations
medicalInventory.expirationsMonitored(async ({ expiringItems }) => {
  for (const item of expiringItems) {
    if (item.daysUntilExpiration <= 14) {
      await medicalInventory.rotateStock({
        itemId: item.id,
        fromLocation: item.currentLocation,
        toLocation: `${item.department}-Front-Stock`,
        reason: 'expiration_approaching'
      })
    }
  }
})

// Alert clinical staff when recall affects current inventory
medicalInventory.recallProcessed(async ({ recallNotice, affectedItems }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'clinical-leadership',
    priority: 'critical',
    subject: `RECALL: ${affectedItems.length} items quarantined`,
    body: `Recall notice ${recallNotice} has been processed. Affected inventory removed from use.`
  })
})
```
