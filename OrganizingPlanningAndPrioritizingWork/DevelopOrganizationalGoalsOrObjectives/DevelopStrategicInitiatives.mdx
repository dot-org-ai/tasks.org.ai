## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { developStrategicInitiatives } from '@headlessly/develop-strategic-initiatives'

const strategy = developStrategicInitiatives()

// Identify strategic gaps
const gaps = await strategy.identifyStrategicGaps({
  organization: 'Consolidated Industries',
  strategicPlan: 'SP-2026-2030',
  areas: [
    { capability: 'digital-commerce', current: 'emerging', target: 'advanced' },
    { capability: 'supply-chain-resilience', current: 'basic', target: 'leading' },
    { capability: 'sustainability-reporting', current: 'none', target: 'compliant' }
  ]
})

// Develop business case
const businessCase = await strategy.developBusinessCase({
  gapId: gaps.items[0].id,
  title: 'Direct-to-Consumer Digital Platform',
  investment: 4500000,
  timeline: '18 months',
  projectedROI: 2.8,
  revenueImpact: 12000000,
  risks: ['channel-conflict', 'technology-integration', 'customer-acquisition-cost']
})

// Charter the initiative
await strategy.charterInitiative({
  businessCaseId: businessCase.id,
  sponsor: 'cro-office',
  objectives: [
    'Launch D2C platform within 12 months',
    'Acquire 50,000 direct customers in year one',
    'Achieve 15% gross margin improvement on direct sales'
  ],
  governance: { steeringReview: 'monthly', boardUpdate: 'quarterly' }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert investment committee when high-value initiatives are chartered
strategy.initiativeChartered(async ({ initiativeId, investment }) => {
  if (investment > 2000000) {
    await notify({
      to: 'investment-committee',
      message: `Initiative ${initiativeId} chartered at $${investment.toLocaleString()} - governance review required`
    })
  }
})

// Escalate underperforming initiatives
strategy.performanceTracked(async ({ initiativeId, metrics }) => {
  const underperforming = metrics.filter(m => m.actual < m.target * 0.7)
  if (underperforming.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'chief-strategy-officer',
      message: `Initiative ${initiativeId} underperforming on ${underperforming.length} metric(s) - review needed`
    })
