## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { developOrganizationalGoalsObjectives } from '@headlessly/develop-organizational-goals-objectives'

const goals = developOrganizationalGoalsObjectives()

// Conduct environmental scan
const scan = await goals.conductEnvironmentalScan({
  organization: 'Meridian Health Systems',
  strengths: ['top-rated-cardiac-program', 'regional-market-leader'],
  weaknesses: ['aging-IT-infrastructure', 'nursing-shortage'],
  opportunities: ['telehealth-expansion', 'value-based-care-contracts'],
  threats: ['competitor-mergers', 'reimbursement-cuts']
})

// Establish strategic goals
const strategic = await goals.establishStrategicGoals({
  scanId: scan.id,
  planningPeriod: 'FY2026-FY2028',
  goals: [
    { name: 'Expand Telehealth Services', target: '40% of outpatient visits by 2028' },
    { name: 'Improve Patient Satisfaction', target: 'Top quartile HCAHPS by 2027' },
    { name: 'Reduce Operating Costs', target: '8% reduction in cost per case by 2028' }
  ]
})

// Define departmental objectives
await goals.defineObjectives({
  goalId: strategic.goals[0].id,
  objectives: [
    { department: 'IT', target: 'Deploy unified telehealth platform by Q2 2026' },
    { department: 'Clinical Operations', target: 'Train 200 providers on virtual care by Q4 2026' },
    { department: 'Marketing', target: 'Achieve 50,000 patient portal registrations by Q1 2027' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify leadership when goals are cascaded
goals.goalsCascaded(async ({ organizationId, planningPeriod }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'executive-team',
    message: `${planningPeriod} goals have been cascaded - review individual objectives in the portal`
  })
})

// Flag underperforming objectives during review
goals.progressReviewed(async ({ objectiveId, actual, target }) => {
  if (actual / target < 0.6) {
    await notify({
      to: 'strategy-director',
      message: `Objective ${objectiveId} is at ${Math.round(actual / target * 100)}% of target - intervention needed`
    })
  }
})
```
