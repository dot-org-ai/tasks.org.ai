## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { developBusinessAndOrganizationalPolicies } from '@headlessly/develop-business-and-organizational-policies'

const policies = developBusinessAndOrganizationalPolicies()

// Assess the need for a new policy
const need = await policies.assessPolicyNeed({
  area: 'artificial-intelligence-governance',
  triggers: ['EU-AI-Act', 'customer-contract-requirements', 'board-directive'],
  affectedUnits: ['engineering', 'product', 'legal', 'customer-success']
})

// Draft the enterprise policy
const draft = await policies.draftEnterprisePolicy({
  needId: need.id,
  title: 'Responsible AI Use and Governance Policy',
  scope: 'All business units deploying or procuring AI systems',
  sections: [
    'purpose-and-scope',
    'AI-system-classification',
    'risk-assessment-requirements',
    'human-oversight-mandates',
    'transparency-and-documentation',
    'prohibited-uses',
    'exception-process',
    'enforcement-and-sanctions'
  ]
})

// Conduct cross-functional review
await policies.conductCrossFunctionalReview({
  draftId: draft.id,
  reviewers: [
    { unit: 'legal', reviewer: 'associate-general-counsel' },
    { unit: 'engineering', reviewer: 'vp-engineering' },
    { unit: 'product', reviewer: 'chief-product-officer' },
    { unit: 'hr', reviewer: 'chro' }
  ],
  deadline: '2026-05-15'

```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify all business units on policy rollout
policies.policyRolledOut(async ({ policyId, title }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'all-managers',
    message: `New enterprise policy: ${title} - mandatory training due within 30 days`
  })
})

// Escalate policy exceptions for review
policies.policyExceptionGranted(async ({ policyId, businessUnit, expirationDate }) => {
  await scheduleReminder({
    date: expirationDate,
    to: 'policy-director',
    message: `Policy exception for ${businessUnit} on ${policyId} expires - review for renewal or remediation`
  })
})
```
