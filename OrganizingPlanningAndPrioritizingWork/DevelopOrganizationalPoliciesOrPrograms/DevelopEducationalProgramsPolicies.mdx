## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { developEducationalProgramsAndPolicies } from '@headlessly/develop-educational-programs-and-policies'

const edDev = developEducationalProgramsAndPolicies()

// Conduct needs assessment
const needs = await edDev.conductNeedsAssessment({
  institution: 'Central Valley Community College',
  discipline: 'healthcare-informatics',
  level: 'associate-degree',
  marketData: {
    regionalDemand: 'high',
    projectedJobGrowth: 0.18,
    competitorPrograms: 2,
    studentInterestSurvey: { respondents: 340, interested: 0.62 }
  }
})

// Design the academic program
const program = await edDev.designProgram({
  assessmentId: needs.id,
  name: 'Associate of Applied Science in Healthcare Informatics',
  credits: 64,
  duration: '4 semesters',
  courses: [
    { title: 'Introduction to Health Information Systems', credits: 3, semester: 1 },
