## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { createOrganizationalPoliciesAndProcedures } from '@headlessly/create-organizational-policies-and-procedures'

const policyMgmt = createOrganizationalPoliciesAndProcedures()

// Identify policy gaps
const gaps = await policyMgmt.identifyPolicyGaps({
  organization: 'Regional Medical Center',
  domains: ['data-privacy', 'workplace-safety', 'vendor-management', 'remote-work'],
  regulations: ['HIPAA', 'OSHA', 'state-labor-code']
})

// Draft a policy document
const draft = await policyMgmt.draftPolicyDocument({
  gapId: gaps.items[0].id,
  title: 'Protected Health Information Access and Handling Policy',
  scope: 'All workforce members with access to patient data',
  sections: [
    'purpose',
    'definitions',
    'minimum-necessary-standard',
    'access-authorization',
    'breach-notification',
    'sanctions-for-violations'
  ],
  effectiveDate: '2026-07-01'
})

// Define supporting procedures
await policyMgmt.defineProcedures({
  policyId: draft.id,
  procedures: [
    { name: 'PHI Access Request Process', steps: ['submit-form', 'manager-review', 'privacy-officer-approval', 'IT-provisioning'] },
    { name: 'Breach Reporting Process', steps: ['identify-incident', 'report-to-privacy-officer', 'assess-scope', 'notify-HHS-if-required'] }

policyMgmt.policyPublished(async ({ policyId, title }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'compliance-team',
    message: `New policy published: ${title} - update compliance tracking and training schedule`
  })
})

// Auto-schedule periodic review
policyMgmt.approvalObtained(async ({ policyId, reviewCycle }) => {
  await scheduleReminder({
    date: addMonths(new Date(), reviewCycle),
    to: 'policy-owner',
    message: `Policy ${policyId} is due for scheduled review`
  })
})
```
