# Coordinate Academic Research Projects

> Business-as-Code definition for coordinating academic research projects from proposal development through execution, data collection, publication, and grant closeout.

## Overview

Academic research project coordination involves securing funding, assembling research teams, managing Institutional Review Board approvals, overseeing data collection and analysis, tracking budgets and timelines, ensuring regulatory compliance, and coordinating publication and dissemination of findings. This definition models the complete research lifecycle from initial proposal through grant closeout and archival.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { coordinateAcademicResearchProjects } from '@headlessly/coordinate-academic-research-projects'

const research = coordinateAcademicResearchProjects()

// Develop a research proposal
const proposal = await research.developProposal({
  title: 'Machine Learning Approaches to Early Alzheimer Detection',
  pi: 'dr-chen-neuroscience',
  agency: 'NIH-NIA',
  mechanism: 'R01',
  budget: { total: 1250000, years: 3 },
  aims: [
    'Develop MRI-based biomarker detection pipeline',
    'Validate model on longitudinal ADNI cohort',
    'Conduct prospective clinical evaluation'
  ]
})

// Submit for funding
await research.submitForFunding({
  proposalId: proposal.id,
  agency: 'NIH-NIA',
  deadline: '2026-06-05T17:00:00-05:00',
  grantNumber: 'PA-26-042'
})

// Manage the project timeline
await research.manageTimeline({
  grantId: 'NIH-1R01AG099123-01',
  milestones: [
    { name: 'IRB approval', deadline: '2026-09-01' },
    { name: 'Data collection complete', deadline: '2027-08-31' },
    { name: 'Model validation', deadline: '2028-03-31' },
    { name: 'Manuscript submission', deadline: '2028-12-01' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert PI when budget threshold is reached
research.budgetThresholdReached(async ({ grantId, percentSpent }) => {
  if (percentSpent >= 75) {
    await notify({
      to: 'principal-investigator',
      message: `Grant ${grantId} is at ${percentSpent}% expenditure - review remaining milestones`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-remind for progress report deadlines
research.milestoneReached(async ({ grantId, milestone }) => {
  if (milestone === 'annual-report-due') {
    await research.submitProgressReport({ grantId })
  }
})
```
