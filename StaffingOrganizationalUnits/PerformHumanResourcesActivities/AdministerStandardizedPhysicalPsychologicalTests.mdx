## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { administerStandardizedPhysicalPsychologicalTests } from '@headlessly/administer-standardized-physical-psychological-tests'

const testing = administerStandardizedPhysicalPsychologicalTests()

// Select an instrument for pre-employment screening
const instrument = await testing.selectInstrument({
  purpose: 'pre-employment',
  type: 'cognitive-ability',
  role: 'Air Traffic Controller',
  validatedFor: ['attention', 'spatial-reasoning', 'stress-tolerance']
})

// Schedule a test session
const session = await testing.scheduleTestSession({
  instrumentId: instrument.id,
  candidateId: 'cand-9172',
  date: '2026-04-10',
  location: 'Testing Center A',
  proctor: 'admin-psych-01'
})

// Score and generate report after administration
const results = await testing.scoreTest({
  sessionId: session.id,
  responses: session.completedResponses
})

await testing.generateTestReport({
  sessionId: session.id,
  resultId: results.id,
  includeNormativeComparison: true
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify HR when test report is ready
testing.testReportGenerated(async ({ candidateId, instrumentType, reportId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'hiring-team',
    message: `${instrumentType} assessment report ready for candidate ${candidateId}`
  })
})

// Flag candidates requiring accommodation follow-up
testing.accommodationProcessed(async ({ candidateId, status, accommodationType }) => {
  if (status === 'approved') {
    await testing.scheduleTestSession({
      candidateId,
      accommodations: [accommodationType]
    })
  }
})
```
