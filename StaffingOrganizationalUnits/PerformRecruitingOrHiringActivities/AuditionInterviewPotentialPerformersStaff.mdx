### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { auditionInterviewPotentialPerformersStaff } from '@headlessly/audition-interview-potential-performers-staff'

const casting = auditionInterviewPotentialPerformersStaff()

// Schedule an audition session
const session = await casting.scheduleAudition({
  production: 'Summer Musical Revue 2026',
  role: 'Lead Vocalist',
  date: '2026-04-10',
  location: 'Studio B, Main Theater',
  requirements: ['vocal-range-soprano', 'dance-proficiency', 'acting-experience']

// Review and audition candidates
const profile = await casting.reviewCandidateProfile({
  candidateId: 'perf-8923',

})

await casting.conductAudition({
  sessionId: session.id,
  candidateId: profile.candidateId,
  material: 'prepared-monologue-and-song'
})

// Evaluate and decide

  sessionId: session.id,
  candidateId: profile.candidateId,

casting.performanceEvaluated(async ({ candidateId, scores, sessionId }) => {
  const average = Object.values(scores).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / Object.values(scores).length
  if (average >= 8.0) {
    await casting.requestCallback({
      candidateId,
      sessionId,
      notes: `High overall score: ${average}`
    })
  }
})

// Notify agents when casting decisions are made
casting.castingDecisionMade(async ({ selectedCandidate, role, production }) => {
  await notify({

    message: `Your client has been selected for ${role} in ${production}`
