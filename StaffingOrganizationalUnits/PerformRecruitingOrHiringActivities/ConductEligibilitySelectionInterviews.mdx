## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { conductEligibilitySelectionInterviews } from '@headlessly/conduct-eligibility-selection-interviews'

const interviews = conductEligibilitySelectionInterviews()

// Prepare an interview guide
const guide = await interviews.prepareInterviewGuide({
  position: 'Product Manager',
  competencies: ['strategic-thinking', 'stakeholder-management', 'data-analysis'],
  questionCount: 8,
  format: 'behavioral'
})

// Screen eligibility and schedule
await interviews.screenEligibility({
  candidateId: 'cand-5503',
  criteria: { minYearsExperience: 5, requiredDegree: 'bachelors', requiredSkills: ['product-strategy'] }
})

await interviews.scheduleInterview({
  candidateId: 'cand-5503',
  guideId: guide.id,
  panelists: ['emp-101', 'emp-205', 'emp-312'],
  date: '2026-05-08',
  format: 'video',
  duration: 60
})

// Submit evaluation after interview

  candidateId: 'cand-5503',
  panelistId: 'emp-101',
  ratings: {
    strategicThinking: 4,
    stakeholderManagement: 5,

interviews.candidateEvaluated(async ({ candidateId, positionId }) => {
  const evaluations = await interviews.getEvaluations({ candidateId, positionId })
  const totalPanelists = 3
  if (evaluations.length === totalPanelists) {
    await interviews.consolidateFeedback({ candidateId, positionId })
  }
})

// Notify candidate of outcome
interviews.selectionDecisionMade(async ({ candidateId, decision, positionId }) => {
  const status = decision === 'selected' ? 'moving forward' : 'not selected'
  await notify({
