## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { addGarnishesFood } from '@headlessly/add-garnishes-food'

const garnishing = addGarnishesFood()

// Select garnish for a pan-seared salmon plate
const garnish = await garnishing.selectGarnish({
  dishId: 'pan-seared-salmon',
  menuItemId: 'dinner-salmon-entree',
  serviceTicketId: 'TKT-8842'
})

// Apply the garnish to the plated dish
await garnishing.applyGarnish({
  dishId: 'pan-seared-salmon',
  garnishId: garnish.id,
  placement: 'top-center',
  elements: ['dill-sprig', 'lemon-zest', 'microgreen-cluster']

// Reorder garnish when stock runs low
garnishing.garnishStockLow(async ({ garnishItem, currentLevel, threshold }) => {
  await createPurchaseOrder({
    item: garnishItem,
    quantity: threshold * 3,
    vendor: 'produce-supplier'
  })
})

// Notify chef when a plate is rejected
garnishing.presentationRejected(async ({ dishId, serviceTicketId, reason }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'executive-chef',
    message: `Plate ${dishId} on ticket ${serviceTicketId} rejected: ${reason}`
  })
})
```
