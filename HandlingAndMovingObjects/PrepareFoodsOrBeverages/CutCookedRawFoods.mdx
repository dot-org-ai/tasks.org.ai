## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { cutCookedRawFoods } from '@headlessly/cut-cooked-raw-foods'

const cutting = cutCookedRawFoods()

// Cut carrots to brunoise for a mirepoix
await cutting.cutFood({
  foodItemId: 'carrot-raw',
  cutStyle: 'brunoise',
  dimensionMm: { length: 3, width: 3, height: 3 },
  quantityKg: 2.5,
  station: 'cold-prep'
})

// Portion a roasted prime rib for service
await cutting.portionFood({
  foodItemId: 'prime-rib-roasted',
  portionSizeG: 340,
  portionCount: 24,
  cutStyle: 'carve-slice'
})

// Log the session waste
await cutting.trimWaste({
  batchId: 'CB-2026-0205-AM',
  wasteKg: 1.8,
  wasteType: 'vegetable-trim'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert sous chef on quality failures
cutting.cutQualityFailed(async ({ foodItemId, cutStyle, reason }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'sous-chef',
    message: `Cut quality issue on ${foodItemId} (${cutStyle}): ${reason}`
  })
})

// Track waste percentages for cost control
cutting.wasteLogged(async ({ batchId, wasteKg, foodItemId }) => {
  await updateWasteMetrics({
    batchId,
    wasteKg,
    item: foodItemId
  })
})
```
