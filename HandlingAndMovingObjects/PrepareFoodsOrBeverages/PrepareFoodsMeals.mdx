# Prepare Foods Meals

> Business-as-Code definition for preparing foods and meals. Models the end-to-end meal preparation process from recipe selection through assembling complete dishes for service.

## Overview

Preparing foods and meals covers the full workflow of producing finished dishes, from selecting recipes and gathering prepped ingredients through cooking, assembly, quality verification, and plating. This definition is broader than individual prep or cooking tasks, focusing on the coordination of multiple components into complete meals. It exposes actions for meal assembly and batch production, events for service coordination, and searches for menu planning and production tracking.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { prepareFoodsMeals } from '@headlessly/prepare-foods-meals'

const meals = prepareFoodsMeals()

// Plan meals for a hospital cafeteria lunch service
const plan = await meals.planMeal({
  facilityId: 'hospital-cafeteria-main',
  serviceDate: '2026-02-05',
  servicePeriod: 'lunch',
  coverCount: 350,
  dietaryCategories: ['regular', 'low-sodium', 'diabetic', 'renal']
})

// Batch produce the regular entree
await meals.batchProduce({
  mealPlanId: plan.id,
  recipeId: 'grilled-chicken-breast-herb',
  quantity: 200,
  productionStation: 'hot-line'
})

// Plate and complete an individual order
await meals.plateMeal({
  serviceTicketId: 'TKT-9920',
  components: ['grilled-chicken-breast', 'steamed-broccoli', 'brown-rice'],
  presentation: 'standard-tray'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify service when batch is ready
meals.batchProduced(async ({ mealPlanId, recipeId, quantity }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'service-line',
    message: `${quantity} portions of ${recipeId} ready for assembly`
  })
})

// Alert quality lead on temperature issues
meals.temperatureChecked(async ({ mealId, temperature, safe }) => {
  if (!safe) {
    await notify({
      to: 'qa-lead',
      message: `Temperature issue on meal ${mealId}: ${temperature}F`
    })
  }
})
```
