# Cook Foods

> Business-as-Code definition for cooking foods. Models the application of heat to transform raw or prepared ingredients into finished dishes using techniques such as grilling, sauteing, roasting, frying, and braising.

## Overview

Cooking foods involves applying heat through various methods to transform prepared ingredients into ready-to-serve dishes. This includes dry-heat methods such as grilling, roasting, and sauteing, moist-heat methods such as boiling, steaming, and braising, and combination methods such as frying and stewing. This definition exposes actions for each cooking technique, events for monitoring doneness and quality, and searches for recipe parameters and cooking records.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { cookFoods } from '@headlessly/cook-foods'

const cooking = cookFoods()

// Preheat the grill station
await cooking.preheatEquipment({
  stationId: 'grill-station-1',
  targetTemperatureC: 260,
  method: 'grill'
})

// Grill a ribeye steak to medium-rare
await cooking.grillFoods({
  cookingOrderId: 'TKT-7723',
  item: 'ribeye-steak',
  weightG: 340,
  doneness: 'medium-rare',
  targetInternalTempC: 57
})

// Verify doneness
const check = await cooking.checkDoneness({
  cookingOrderId: 'TKT-7723',
  item: 'ribeye-steak',
  method: 'probe-thermometer'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify expeditor when item is done
cooking.donenessConfirmed(async ({ cookingOrderId, item, doneness }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'expeditor',
    message: `${item} on ticket ${cookingOrderId} cooked to ${doneness}, ready to plate`
  })
})

// Alert when equipment fails to preheat
cooking.equipmentPreheated(async ({ stationId, actualTemperatureC, targetTemperatureC }) => {
  if (Math.abs(actualTemperatureC - targetTemperatureC) > 10) {
    await notify({
      to: 'sous-chef',
      message: `Station ${stationId} at ${actualTemperatureC}C, target was ${targetTemperatureC}C`
    })
  }
})
```
