  })
})

// Alert expeditor when plates are held too long
arranging.presentationApproved(async ({ serviceTicketId, timestamp }) => {
  setTimeout(async () => {
    const status = await arranging.findDispatchedPlates({ serviceTicketId })
    if (!status.dispatched) {
      await notify({
        to: 'expeditor',
        message: `Ticket ${serviceTicketId} plated but not yet dispatched`
