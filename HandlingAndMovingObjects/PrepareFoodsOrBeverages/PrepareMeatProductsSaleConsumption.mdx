### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { prepareMeatProductsSaleConsumption } from '@headlessly/prepare-meat-products-sale-consumption'

const meatPrep = prepareMeatProductsSaleConsumption()

// Season chicken thighs with a teriyaki marinade
await meatPrep.seasonMeat({
  productType: 'chicken-thigh-boneless',
  seasoningId: 'teriyaki-marinade',
  quantityKg: 10,
  marinateHours: 4,
  lotId: 'LOT-2026-0205-01'
})

// Grind beef and form into half-pound patties
await meatPrep.grindForm({
  inputMeat: 'beef-chuck-trim',
  leanPercentage: 80,
  grindSize: 'coarse',
  formType: 'patty',
  portionWeightG: 227,
  lotId: 'LOT-2026-0205-02'
})

// Package and label for the display case
await meatPrep.packageProduct({
  lotId: 'LOT-2026-0205-02',

```typescript
// Update display inventory when products are labeled
meatPrep.productLabeled(async ({ lotId, productType, quantity }) => {
  await updateDisplayInventory({
    productType,
    addQuantity: quantity,
    lotId
  })
})

// Alert manager when curing times complete
meatPrep.meatCured(async ({ lotId, productType, cureHours }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'meat-department-manager',
    message: `Cure complete for ${productType} lot ${lotId} after ${cureHours}h`
  })
})
