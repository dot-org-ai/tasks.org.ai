# Install Insulation Equipment Structures

> Business-as-Code definition for thermal and acoustic insulation installation. Models the complete process from energy analysis through material selection, installation, and performance testing for residential, commercial, and industrial applications.

## Overview

Insulation installation involves assessing thermal performance requirements, selecting appropriate insulation materials, preparing cavities and surfaces, and installing fiberglass batts, spray foam, rigid board, or blown-in insulation. This definition exposes actions for energy auditing, R-value specification, installation coordination, and thermal imaging verification to achieve building energy efficiency and acoustic control.

## Actors

| InsulationSupplier | Provides materials including batts, foam, and equipment |
| BuildingInspector | Verifies code compliance and R-value requirements |
| HVAC Contractor | Coordinates insulation with mechanical systems |
| UtilityCompany | Offers rebates for energy efficiency improvements |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { installInsulationEquipmentStructures } from '@headlessly/install-insulation-equipment-structures'

const insulation = installInsulationEquipmentStructures()

// Conduct energy audit and specify insulation
const assessment = await insulation.assessThermalPerformance({
  buildingId: 'residential-1950s-ranch',
  areas: ['attic', 'walls', 'basement'],
  currentRValue: { attic: 11, walls: 0, basement: 0 },
  targetRValue: { attic: 49, walls: 21, basement: 19 }
})

const specification = await insulation.specifyInsulation({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  materials: [
    { area: 'attic', type: 'blown-fiberglass', targetR: 49, depth: '16-inches' },
    { area: 'walls', type: 'spray-foam-closed-cell', targetR: 21, thickness: '3.5-inches' },
    { area: 'basement', type: 'rigid-foam-board', targetR: 19, thickness: '3-inches' }
  ]
})

// Schedule installation and verify performance
await insulation.orderMaterials({
  specificationId: specification.id,
  supplier: 'insulation-distributors',
  delivery: 'job-site',
  installDate: '2026-04-10'
})

await insulation.applySprayFoam({
  area: 'wall-cavities',
  type: 'closed-cell-polyurethane',
  thickness: '3.5-inches',
  coverage: 1200
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-schedule thermal imaging after installation
insulation.foamApplied(async ({ projectId, area }) => {
  const cureTime = new Date()
  cureTime.setHours(cureTime.getHours() + 24)

  await insulation.verifyPerformance({
    projectId,
    area,
    method: 'thermal-imaging',
    scheduledDate: cureTime.toISOString(),
    inspector: 'certified-thermographer'
  })
})

// Submit rebate application after verification
insulation.performanceVerified(async ({ projectId, performanceGain }) => {
  if (performanceGain >= 0.30) {
    await submitRebateApplication({
      projectId,
      utilityProgram: 'energy-efficiency-incentive',
      improvement: performanceGain,
      documentation: 'thermal-images'
    })
  }
})
```
