# Install Safety Support Equipment

> Business-as-Code definition for installing safety and support equipment in construction and industrial environments. Models the complete installation lifecycle from planning through inspection and certification.

## Overview

Installing safety or support equipment involves mounting, securing, and testing protective systems such as guardrails, scaffolding, harnesses, fall protection, and structural bracing. This definition exposes actions for installation planning, execution, and verification, with events for compliance tracking and automated safety audits.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { installSafetySupportEquipment } from '@headlessly/install-safety-support-equipment'

const safety = installSafetySupportEquipment()

// Plan guardrail installation for rooftop work area
const plan = await safety.planInstallation({
  location: 'Building A - Rooftop',
  equipmentType: 'Perimeter Guardrail System',
  installDate: '2026-02-15',
  technicians: ['tech-101', 'tech-102']
})

// Mount equipment and secure fasteners
await safety.mountEquipment({
  planId: plan.id,
  anchorPoints: ['A1', 'A2', 'A3', 'A4'],
  mountingMethod: 'Concrete Anchor Bolts'
})

await safety.secureFasteners({
  planId: plan.id,
  torqueSpecification: '50 ft-lbs',
  verificationMethod: 'Torque Wrench'
})

// Test and certify installation
const testResult = await safety.testStability({
  planId: plan.id,
  loadTest: { force: 200, unit: 'lbs', direction: 'outward' }
})

const inspection = await safety.inspectInstallation({
  planId: plan.id,
  inspector: 'inspector-001',
  standard: 'OSHA 1926.502'
})

await safety.certifyCompletion({
  planId: plan.id,
  inspectionId: inspection.id,
  validUntil: '2027-02-15'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on failed stability tests
safety.stabilityTested(async ({ planId, testResult }) => {
  if (!testResult.passed) {
    await notify({
      to: 'safety-team',
      priority: 'high',
      message: `Stability test failed for installation ${planId}`
    })
  }
})

// Schedule reinspection before certification expires
safety.completionCertified(async ({ planId, validUntil }) => {
  const reinspectionDate = new Date(validUntil)
  reinspectionDate.setDate(reinspectionDate.getDate() - 30)

  await safety.scheduleReinspection({
    planId,
    inspectionDate: reinspectionDate.toISOString()
  })
})
```
