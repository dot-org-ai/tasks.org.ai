## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { installHardwareInteriorFixtures } from '@headlessly/install-hardware-interior-fixtures'

const interiorHardware = installHardwareInteriorFixtures()

// Specify hardware for residential renovation
const schedule = await interiorHardware.specifyHardware({
  projectId: 'renovation-oak-street',
  rooms: [
    {
      name: 'master-bath',
      fixtures: [
        { type: 'towel-bar', finish: 'brushed-nickel', quantity: 3 },
        { type: 'toilet-paper-holder', finish: 'brushed-nickel', quantity: 2 },
        { type: 'robe-hook', finish: 'brushed-nickel', quantity: 2 }
      ]
    },
    {
      name: 'kitchen',
      fixtures: [
        { type: 'cabinet-pull', finish: 'matte-black', quantity: 24 },
        { type: 'cabinet-knob', finish: 'matte-black', quantity: 12 }
      ]
    }
  ]
})

// Order and stage hardware
await interiorHardware.orderFixtures({
  scheduleId: schedule.id,
  supplier: 'builders-hardware-supply',
  delivery: 'contractor-warehouse',
  urgency: 'standard'
})

await interiorHardware.stageHardware({
  scheduleId: schedule.id,
  organization: 'by-room',
  location: 'job-site-staging'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-prepare substrate after hardware arrives
interiorHardware.hardwareStaged(async ({ scheduleId, location }) => {
  const schedule = await interiorHardware.getSchedule(scheduleId)

  await interiorHardware.prepareSubstrate({
    scheduleId,
    tasks: schedule.fixtures.map(f => ({
      type: f.type,
      locations: f.mountingPoints,
      backing: f.requiresBacking
    }))
  })
})

// Create punch list from inspection findings
interiorHardware.installationInspected(async ({ scheduleId, issues }) => {
  if (issues.length > 0) {
    await createPunchList({
      projectId: scheduleId,
      items: issues,
      priority: 'before-closeout',
      assignedTo: 'finish-crew'
    })
  }
})
```
