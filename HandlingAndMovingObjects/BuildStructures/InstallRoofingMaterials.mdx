# Install Roofing Materials

> Business-as-Code definition for roofing system installation. Models the complete process from inspection and specification through deck preparation, underlayment, material installation, flashing, and warranty activation for residential and commercial applications.

## Overview

Roofing material installation involves assessing existing conditions, specifying appropriate systems, preparing roof decks, installing underlayment and ice barriers, laying shingles or membrane materials, installing flashing and ventilation, and ensuring proper sealing and drainage. This definition exposes actions for roof evaluation, material specification, installation coordination, and quality verification to deliver weather-tight, code-compliant roofing systems.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { installRoofingMaterials } from '@headlessly/install-roofing-materials'

const roofing = installRoofingMaterials()

// Inspect existing roof and specify replacement
const inspection = await roofing.inspectRoof({
  propertyId: 'residential-123-maple-st',
  buildingType: 'single-family',
  roofAge: 22,
  findings: ['shingle-curling', 'missing-tabs', 'flashing-deterioration'],
  recommendation: 'full-replacement'
})

const specification = await roofing.specifyMaterials({
  inspectionId: inspection.id,
  system: {
    shingles: { type: 'architectural', brand: 'certainteed-landmark', color: 'weathered-wood' },
    underlayment: { type: 'synthetic', brand: 'titanium-udl' },
    iceBarrier: { coverage: 'eaves-and-valleys' },
    ventilation: { type: 'ridge-vent', linearFeet: 65 }
  },
  warranty: '50-year-limited'
})

// Order materials and prepare for installation
await roofing.orderMaterials({
  specificationId: specification.id,
  supplier: 'abc-roofing-supply',
  delivery: 'ground-level-drop',
  installDate: '2026-05-15'
})

await roofing.prepareDeck({
  propertyId: inspection.propertyId,
  tasks: ['remove-old-shingles', 'inspect-decking', 'replace-damaged-boards', 'install-drip-edge']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-schedule deck prep when materials arrive
roofing.materialsOrdered(async ({ specificationId, deliveryDate }) => {
  const prepDate = new Date(deliveryDate)
  prepDate.setDate(prepDate.getDate() - 1)

  await roofing.prepareDeck({
    specificationId,
    scheduledDate: prepDate.toISOString(),
    crew: 'tear-off-team'
  })
})

// Request manufacturer inspection after completion
roofing.flashingInstalled(async ({ specificationId, completionDate }) => {
  await scheduleWarrantyInspection({
    specificationId,
    inspector: 'manufacturer-certified',
    purpose: 'warranty-activation',
    requestDate: completionDate
  })
})
```
