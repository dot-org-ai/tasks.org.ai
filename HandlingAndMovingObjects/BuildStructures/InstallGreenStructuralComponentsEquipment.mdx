# Install Green Structural Components Equipment

> Business-as-Code definition for sustainable building component and equipment installation. Models the complete process from LEED certification planning through green roof systems, solar integration, rainwater harvesting, and energy-efficient building envelope installation.

## Overview

Green structural component and equipment installation involves integrating sustainable technologies into building construction, including living walls, green roofs, photovoltaic systems, geothermal infrastructure, and high-performance insulation. This definition exposes actions for sustainable design specification, certification coordination, installation management, and performance monitoring to achieve environmental building standards.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { installGreenStructuralComponentsEquipment } from '@headlessly/install-green-structural-components-equipment'

const greenBuilding = installGreenStructuralComponentsEquipment()

// Design integrated green systems for commercial building
const system = await greenBuilding.designGreenSystem({
  buildingId: 'office-tower-downtown',
  targetCertification: 'LEED-Gold',
  systems: [
    { type: 'green-roof', area: 15000, vegetation: 'sedum-mix' },
    { type: 'solar-array', capacity: '250-kW', orientation: 'south' },
    { type: 'rainwater-harvesting', storage: 10000 }
  ],
  energyTarget: '40-percent-reduction'
})

// Submit for LEED certification
const certification = await greenBuilding.certifyDesign({
  systemId: system.id,
  standard: 'LEED-v4.1',
  category: 'New-Construction',
  documentation: system.drawings
})

// Install green roof after structural prep
await greenBuilding.prepareStructure({
  systemId: system.id,
  reinforcement: 'load-bearing-upgrade',
  waterproofing: 'root-barrier-membrane'
})

await greenBuilding.installGreenRoof({
  systemId: system.id,
  drainage: 'modular-tray',
  growing-medium: '4-inch-depth',
  irrigation: 'drip-system'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-monitor performance after installation
greenBuilding.solarArrayInstalled(async ({ systemId, capacity }) => {
  await greenBuilding.monitorPerformance({
    systemId,
    metrics: ['energy-production', 'carbon-offset', 'grid-feed'],
    interval: 'hourly',
    alertThreshold: 0.85
  })
})

// Schedule certification inspection after all systems complete
greenBuilding.greenRoofInstalled(async ({ systemId }) => {
  const allSystems = await checkSystemsComplete(systemId)

  if (allSystems) {
    await scheduleCertificationInspection({
      systemId,
      inspector: 'leed-ap',
      documentation: 'final-package'
    })
  }
})
```
