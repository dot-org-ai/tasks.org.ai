# Install Trim Paneling

> Business-as-Code definition for installing trim and paneling in construction and renovation projects. Models the complete installation workflow from measurement through finishing and quality inspection.

## Overview

Installing trim or paneling involves cutting, fitting, and securing decorative and protective wall coverings, baseboards, crown molding, and wainscoting. This definition exposes actions for material preparation, installation, and finishing work, with events for quality control and project tracking.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { installTrimPaneling } from '@headlessly/install-trim-paneling'

const trim = installTrimPaneling()

// Measure dining room for wainscoting
const measurements = await trim.measureWalls({
  room: 'Dining Room',
  walls: [
    { id: 'north', length: 144, height: 96 },
    { id: 'south', length: 144, height: 96 },
    { id: 'east', length: 120, height: 96 },
    { id: 'west', length: 120, height: 96 }
  ],
  unit: 'inches'
})

// Cut materials and install panels
const cutList = await trim.cutMaterials({
  measurementId: measurements.id,
  panelHeight: 36,
  material: 'beadboard-panels',
  trimProfile: 'colonial-cap-rail'
})

await trim.applyAdhesive({
  cutListId: cutList.id,
  adhesiveType: 'construction-adhesive',
  pattern: 'serpentine'
})

await trim.installPanels({
  cutListId: cutList.id,
  startingWall: 'north',
  alignment: 'level'
})

// Secure trim and finish
await trim.secureTrim({
  cutListId: cutList.id,
  fastenerType: 'finish-nails',
  spacing: 16
})

await trim.fillJoints({
  cutListId: cutList.id,
  compound: 'wood-filler',
  method: 'putty-knife'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Order additional materials if cut list shows shortage
trim.materialsCut(async ({ cutListId, materials }) => {
  const shortage = materials.filter(m => m.quantity < m.required)

  if (shortage.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'procurement',
      message: `Additional materials needed for ${cutListId}`,
      items: shortage
    })
  }
})

// Schedule painting after inspection passes
trim.finishInspected(async ({ cutListId, inspection }) => {
  if (inspection.status === 'approved') {
    await schedulePainting({
      room: inspection.room,
      priority: 'normal',
      notes: 'Wainscoting ready for primer'
    })
  }
})
```
