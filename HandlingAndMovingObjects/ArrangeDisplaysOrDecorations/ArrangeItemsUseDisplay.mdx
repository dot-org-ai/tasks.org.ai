### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { arrangeItemsUseDisplay } from '@headlessly/arrange-items-use-display'

const items = arrangeItemsUseDisplay()

// Create a layout plan for a trade show booth
const layout = await items.createLayoutPlan({
  spaceId: 'BOOTH-A14',
  event: 'National Hardware Show 2026',
  sections: [
    { name: 'Power Tools', shelfCount: 3, position: 'left-wall' },
    { name: 'Hand Tools', shelfCount: 2, position: 'center-table' },
    { name: 'Accessories', shelfCount: 2, position: 'right-wall' }
  ]
})

// Position items and apply labels
await items.positionItems({
  layoutPlanId: layout.id,
  placements: [
    { section: 'Power Tools', sku: 'DRL-1800', quantity: 4, shelf: 1 },
    { section: 'Hand Tools', sku: 'HMR-16OZ', quantity: 6, shelf: 1 }

// Notify stocking associate when items need replenishment
items.arrangementVerified(async ({ layoutPlanId, depletedSections }) => {
  if (depletedSections.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'stocking-associate',
      message: `Sections need restocking in layout ${layoutPlanId}: ${depletedSections.join(', ')}`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-schedule teardown after event ends
items.itemsPositioned(async ({ layoutPlanId, eventEndDate }) => {
  await scheduleTask({
    action: 'clearArrangement',
    layoutPlanId,
    scheduledAt: eventEndDate
  })
})
```
