# Decorate Indoor Outdoor Spaces

> Business-as-Code definition for decorating indoor or outdoor spaces. Models the process of designing, installing, and managing decorative elements for events, commercial venues, and residential spaces.

Decorating indoor and outdoor spaces involves planning decorative themes, sourcing materials such as florals, drapery, lighting, and furniture, and physically installing these elements to transform a space for events, retail environments, or residential settings.
