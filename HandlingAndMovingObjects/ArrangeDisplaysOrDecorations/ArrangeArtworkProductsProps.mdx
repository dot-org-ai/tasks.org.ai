})

await arrange.positionElements({
  arrangementPlanId: plan.id,
  placements: [
    { itemId: items[0].id, wall: 'north', centerHeight: 60, position: 1 },
    { itemId: items[1].id, wall: 'north', centerHeight: 60, position: 2 }

  await notify({
    to: 'gallery-director',
    message: `Arrangement for ${exhibition} verified -- ready for opening`
  })
})

// Auto-generate condition logs after items are secured
arrange.itemsSecured(async ({ arrangementPlanId, itemIds }) => {
  for (const itemId of itemIds) {
    await createConditionLog({
      itemId,
      arrangementPlanId,
      phase: 'post-installation',
      inspectedAt: new Date()
