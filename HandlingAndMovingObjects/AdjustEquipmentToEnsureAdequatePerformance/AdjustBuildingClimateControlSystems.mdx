# Adjust Building Climate Control Systems

> Business-as-Code definition for building climate control system adjustment. Models the operation and optimization of HVAC equipment to maintain comfortable and efficient indoor environments.

## Overview

Building climate control system adjustment involves monitoring temperature and humidity sensors, modifying thermostat settings, calibrating HVAC controls, balancing airflow, troubleshooting performance issues, and optimizing energy efficiency. This definition exposes actions for environmental monitoring, equipment tuning, and performance optimization.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { adjustBuildingClimateControlSystems } from '@headlessly/adjust-building-climate-control-systems'

const climate = adjustBuildingClimateControlSystems()

// Monitor current conditions
const conditions = await climate.monitorConditions({
  zone: 'floor-3-east',
  metrics: ['temperature', 'humidity', 'co2'],
  interval: 'real-time'
})

// Adjust setpoint in response to occupancy
await climate.adjustSetpoint({
  zone: 'floor-3-east',
  temperature: 72,
  reason: 'high-occupancy-meeting',
  duration: 2
})

// Calibrate sensor after maintenance
await climate.calibrateSensor({
  sensorId: 'temp-sensor-301',
  referenceValue: 70.0,
  tolerance: 0.5,
  calibrationDate: '2026-02-15'
})

// Balance airflow across zones
await climate.balanceAirflow({
  building: 'headquarters',
  zones: ['floor-3-east', 'floor-3-west', 'floor-3-central'],
  targetCFM: [1200, 1000, 800],
  method: 'damper-adjustment'
})

// Optimize schedule for energy savings
await climate.optimizeSchedule({
  zone: 'all-zones',
  weekday: { occupied: '07:00-18:00', setback: 5 },
  weekend: { occupied: 'off', setback: 10 }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert when conditions exceed comfort thresholds
climate.conditionsMonitored(async ({ zone, temperature, humidity }) => {
  if (temperature > 78 || temperature < 68) {
    await climate.troubleshootIssue({
      zone,
      issue: 'temperature-out-of-range',
      priority: 'high'
    })
    await notify({
      to: 'building-operator',
      message: `Zone ${zone} temperature ${temperature}F is outside comfort range`
    })
  }
})

// Log energy usage when schedule optimized
climate.scheduleOptimized(async ({ zone, schedule }) => {
  await climate.logPerformance({
    zone,
    metric: 'energy-savings',
    value: calculateSavings(schedule),
    timestamp: new Date()
  })
})
```
