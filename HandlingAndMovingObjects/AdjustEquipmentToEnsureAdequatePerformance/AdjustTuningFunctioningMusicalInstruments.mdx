# Adjust Tuning Functioning Musical Instruments

> Business-as-Code definition for musical instrument tuning and performance optimization. Models the complete process of pitch adjustment, intonation correction, and mechanical regulation for acoustic and electronic instruments.

## Overview

Musical instrument tuning involves adjusting pitch, intonation, and mechanical function to achieve optimal tonal quality and playability. This definition exposes actions for tuning procedures, voicing adjustments, and maintenance tracking across orchestral, band, and studio environments.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { adjustTuningFunctioningMusicalInstruments } from '@headlessly/adjust-tuning-functioning-musical-instruments'

const instruments = adjustTuningFunctioningMusicalInstruments()

// Tune concert grand piano
await instruments.tuneInstrument({
  instrumentId: 'PIANO-STEINWAY-442',
  standard: 'A440',
  temperament: 'equal',
  tunedBy: 'technician-008',
  venue: 'concert-hall-main'
})

// Check intonation on violin
const intonation = await instruments.checkIntonation({
  instrumentId: 'VIOLIN-STRAD-1707',
  testPoints: ['open-strings', 'harmonics', 'scale'],
  tolerance: 2
})

// Regulate piano action mechanics
await instruments.regulateMechanics({
  instrumentId: 'PIANO-STEINWAY-442',
  adjustments: {
    letoff: 1.5,
    drop: 0.5,
    hammer: 'reshape',
    dampers: 'align'
  },
  regulatedBy: 'technician-008'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Schedule next tuning when stability confirmed
instruments.tuningStabilized(async ({ instrumentId, lastTuned, stability }) => {
  const interval = stability === 'excellent' ? 90 : 30

  await schedule({
    task: 'instrument-tuning',
    instrument: instrumentId,
    daysFromNow: interval,
    assignTo: 'tuning-team'
  })
})

// Alert on poor intonation requiring repair
instruments.intonationChecked(async ({ instrumentId, accuracy, issues }) => {
  if (accuracy < 80) {
    await notify({
      to: 'instrument-shop',
      message: `${instrumentId} intonation ${accuracy}% - repair needed`,
      priority: 'high',
      issues: issues
    })
  }
})
```
