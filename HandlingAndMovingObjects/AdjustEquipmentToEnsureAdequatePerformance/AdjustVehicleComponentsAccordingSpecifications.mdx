## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { adjustVehicleComponentsAccordingSpecifications } from '@headlessly/adjust-vehicle-components-according-specifications'

const vehicle = adjustVehicleComponentsAccordingSpecifications()

// Perform four-wheel alignment
await vehicle.performAlignment({
  vehicleId: 'VIN-1HGCM82633A123456',
  measurements: {
    frontCamber: { left: -0.5, right: -0.3 },
    frontCaster: { left: 3.2, right: 3.5 },
    frontToe: { total: 0.08 },
    rearCamber: { left: -1.2, right: -1.0 },
    rearToe: { total: 0.12 }
  },
  adjustedBy: 'tech-442',
  equipment: 'HUNTER-HWA-700'
})

// Calibrate forward collision sensor
await vehicle.calibrateSensor({
  vehicleId: 'VIN-1HGCM82633A123456',
  sensorType: 'forward-radar',
  system: 'ADAS',
  procedure: 'static-target',
  calibrationTool: 'OEM-SCAN-PRO',
  performedBy: 'tech-089'
})

// Verify adjustment meets specification
const verification = await vehicle.verifyAdjustment({
  vehicleId: 'VIN-1HGCM82633A123456',
  component: 'suspension-alignment',
  tolerance: 'factory-spec'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on out-of-spec adjustment
vehicle.adjustmentVerified(async ({ vehicleId, component, withinSpec, deviation }) => {
  if (!withinSpec) {
    await notify({
      to: 'service-manager',
      message: `${component} on ${vehicleId} out of spec by ${deviation}`,
      priority: 'high'
    })
  }
})

// Update service history on completion
vehicle.calibrationRecord(async ({ vehicleId, calibrations, technician }) => {
  await serviceHistory.update({
    vehicle: vehicleId,
    event: 'calibration-complete',
    systems: calibrations,
    performedBy: technician,
    timestamp: new Date()
  })
})
```
