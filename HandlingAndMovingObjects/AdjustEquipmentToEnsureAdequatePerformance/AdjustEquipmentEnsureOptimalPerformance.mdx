# Adjust Equipment Ensure Optimal Performance

> Business-as-Code definition for equipment calibration and performance optimization. Models inspection, adjustment, testing, and documentation of machinery and tools.

## Overview

Equipment performance adjustment involves inspecting machinery, identifying performance deviations, making calibrations, testing results, and documenting changes to ensure equipment operates within specifications. This definition provides actions for performance assessment, parameter adjustment, validation testing, and maintenance logging.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { adjustEquipmentEnsureOptimalPerformance } from '@headlessly/adjust-equipment-ensure-optimal-performance'

const equipment = adjustEquipmentEnsureOptimalPerformance()

// Inspect equipment performance
const inspection = await equipment.inspectEquipment({
  equipmentId: 'CNC-MILL-05',
  parameters: ['spindle-speed', 'positioning-accuracy', 'tool-offset'],
  inspector: 'tech-smith'
})

// Identify performance deviations
const deviations = await equipment.identifyDeviation({
  inspectionId: inspection.id,
  tolerances: {
    'spindle-speed': { target: 12000, variance: 100 },
    'positioning-accuracy': { target: 0.001, variance: 0.0002 }
  }
})

// Adjust parameters to correct deviations
if (deviations.length > 0) {
  await equipment.adjustParameters({
    equipmentId: 'CNC-MILL-05',
    adjustments: [
      { parameter: 'spindle-speed', from: 12150, to: 12000 },
      { parameter: 'positioning-accuracy', from: 0.0015, to: 0.001 }
    ]
  })

  // Test after adjustment
  const testResult = await equipment.testPerformance({
    equipmentId: 'CNC-MILL-05',
    parameters: ['spindle-speed', 'positioning-accuracy']
  })
}
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert when deviation exceeds critical threshold
equipment.deviationIdentified(async ({ equipmentId, deviation }) => {
  if (deviation.severity === 'Critical') {
    await notify({
      to: 'maintenance-supervisor',
      urgency: 'immediate',
      message: `Critical deviation on ${equipmentId}: ${deviation.parameter}`
    })
  }
})

// Automatically certify equipment when all tests pass
equipment.performanceTested(async ({ equipmentId, results }) => {
  if (results.allPassing) {
    await equipment.documentChanges({ equipmentId })
    await equipment.certifyReadiness({ equipmentId })
  }
})
```
