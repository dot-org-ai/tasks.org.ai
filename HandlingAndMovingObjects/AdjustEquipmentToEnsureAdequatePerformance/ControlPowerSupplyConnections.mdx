# Control Power Supply Connections

> Business-as-Code definition for electrical power distribution and connection management. Models the complete process of establishing, monitoring, and controlling power supply connections for equipment, facilities, and production systems.

## Overview

Power supply connection control involves managing electrical distribution to ensure safe, reliable power delivery to equipment and systems. This definition exposes actions for connection management, load monitoring, and safety interlocks across industrial, commercial, and critical infrastructure environments.

## Actors

| Actor | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Electrician | Establishes and maintains power connections |
| FacilitiesOperator | Monitors and controls building power systems |
| ProductionSupervisor | Coordinates power requirements for manufacturing |
| SafetyOfficer | Ensures electrical safety compliance |
| UtilityProvider | Supplies primary electrical power |
| EquipmentVendor | Specifies power requirements for equipment |

## Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| PowerSystemOperator | Manages electrical distribution panels |
| ConnectionTechnician | Establishes physical power connections |
| LoadMonitor | Tracks power consumption and capacity |
| EmergencyResponder | Handles power system emergencies |

## Entities

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { controlPowerSupplyConnections } from '@headlessly/control-power-supply-connections'

const power = controlPowerSupplyConnections()

// Establish power connection to new equipment
await power.establishConnection({
  equipmentId: 'CNC-MILL-442',
  panelId: 'PANEL-3A',
  circuit: 'C-12',
  voltage: 480,
  amperage: 100,
  phases: 3,
  connectedBy: 'electrician-008'
})

// Monitor power load on circuit
const load = await power.monitorLoad({
  circuitId: 'PANEL-3A-C12',
  interval: 1000,
  duration: 3600
})

// Switch to backup power source
await power.switchPowerSource({
  panelId: 'PANEL-3A',
  fromSource: 'utility-primary',
  toSource: 'generator-backup',
  reason: 'scheduled-maintenance',
  switchedBy: 'operator-042'
})

// Safely disconnect power for maintenance
await power.disconnectPower({
  equipmentId: 'CNC-MILL-442',
  lockoutTagout: true,
  verifyZeroEnergy: true,
  disconnectedBy: 'electrician-008'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on circuit breaker trip
power.breakerTripped(async ({ panelId, circuit, amperage, reason }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'facilities-team',
    message: `Breaker tripped on ${panelId} circuit ${circuit}: ${reason}`,
    priority: 'high'
  })

  // Log for maintenance review
  await maintenanceLog.record({
    event: 'breaker-trip',
    panel: panelId,
    circuit: circuit,
    load: amperage,
    timestamp: new Date()
  })
})

// Trigger emergency shutdown on overload
power.loadMonitored(async ({ circuitId, current, capacity, percentLoad }) => {
  if (percentLoad > 95) {
    await notify({
      to: 'emergency-response',
      message: `Critical overload on ${circuitId}: ${percentLoad}%`,
      priority: 'critical'
    })

    await power.controlCircuitBreaker({
      circuitId: circuitId,
      action: 'trip',
      reason: 'overload-protection'
    })
  }
})
```
