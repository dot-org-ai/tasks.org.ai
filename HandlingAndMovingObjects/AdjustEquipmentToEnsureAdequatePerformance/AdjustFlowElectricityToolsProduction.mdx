# Adjust Flow Electricity Tools Production

> Business-as-Code definition for electrical power management in production environments. Models voltage regulation, load balancing, circuit protection, and power optimization for tools and equipment.

## Overview

Adjusting electrical flow to production equipment involves monitoring voltage and current, regulating power distribution, protecting circuits from overload, and optimizing energy consumption. This definition provides actions for power monitoring, circuit adjustment, load management, and safety compliance.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { adjustFlowElectricityToolsProduction } from '@headlessly/adjust-flow-electricity-tools-production'

const electrical = adjustFlowElectricityToolsProduction()

// Monitor voltage at production equipment
const voltage = await electrical.monitorVoltage({
  equipmentId: 'WELDER-03',
  circuitId: 'CIRCUIT-B12',
  targetVoltage: 480,
  tolerance: 5
})

// Measure current load
const load = await electrical.measureLoad({
  circuitId: 'CIRCUIT-B12',
  equipmentIds: ['WELDER-03', 'GRINDER-08'],
  maxCapacity: 200
})

// Adjust voltage if out of spec
if (voltage.deviation > voltage.tolerance) {
  await electrical.adjustVoltage({
    circuitId: 'CIRCUIT-B12',
    targetVoltage: 480,
    currentVoltage: voltage.measured
  })
}

// Balance load across circuits if overloaded
if (load.percentage > 85) {
  await electrical.balanceLoad({
    sourceCircuit: 'CIRCUIT-B12',
    targetCircuit: 'CIRCUIT-B13',
    equipmentToMove: ['GRINDER-08']
  })
}
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert when voltage deviation exceeds tolerance
electrical.voltageMonitored(async ({ equipmentId, deviation }) => {
  if (Math.abs(deviation) > 10) {
    await notify({
      to: 'electrician-on-duty',
      urgency: 'high',
      message: `Voltage deviation ${deviation}V on ${equipmentId}`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-balance load when circuit approaches capacity
electrical.loadMeasured(async ({ circuitId, percentage }) => {
  if (percentage > 90) {
    await electrical.balanceLoad({
      sourceCircuit: circuitId,
      strategy: 'auto-redistribute'
    })
  }
})
```
