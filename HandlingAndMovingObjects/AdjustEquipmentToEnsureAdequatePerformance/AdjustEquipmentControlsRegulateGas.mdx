# Adjust Equipment Controls Regulate Gas

> Business-as-Code definition for gas flow regulation. Models the adjustment of controls on industrial furnaces, chemical reactors, HVAC systems, and welding equipment to optimize gas delivery and combustion.

## Overview

Gas flow regulation involves monitoring pressure and flow rates, adjusting valve positions, maintaining proper air-fuel ratios, ensuring combustion efficiency, troubleshooting leaks or pressure issues, and complying with safety protocols. This definition exposes actions for flow control, pressure management, combustion optimization, and safety monitoring.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { adjustEquipmentControlsRegulateGas } from '@headlessly/adjust-equipment-controls-regulate-gas'

const gas = adjustEquipmentControlsRegulateGas()

// Monitor industrial furnace gas pressure
const pressure = await gas.monitorPressure({
  equipment: 'heat-treat-furnace-3',
  sensors: ['inlet-pressure', 'burner-pressure', 'flow-rate'],
  interval: 'continuous',
  targetPressure: 15
})

// Adjust valve to increase gas flow
await gas.adjustValve({
  valveId: 'gas-valve-3a',
  position: 65,
  reason: 'ramp-temperature',
  targetFlowRate: 1200
})

// Regulate pressure for consistent combustion
await gas.regulatePressure({
  regulatorId: 'pressure-reg-3',
  targetPressure: 15,
  tolerance: 0.5,
  gasType: 'natural-gas'
})

// Optimize air-fuel ratio
await gas.optimizeCombustion({
  equipment: 'heat-treat-furnace-3',
  targetRatio: 10.5,
  oxygenTarget: 2.5,
  objective: 'maximize-efficiency'
})

// Detect leaks
await gas.detectLeaks({
  area: 'furnace-3-gas-train',
  sensitivity: 'high',
  threshold: 100,
  gasType: 'natural-gas'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert when pressure exceeds safe limits
gas.pressureMonitored(async ({ equipment, pressure, maxPressure }) => {
  if (pressure > maxPressure) {
    await gas.adjustValve({
      equipment,
      position: 0,
      reason: 'emergency-shutoff'
    })
    await notify({
      to: ['equipment-operator', 'safety-inspector'],
      priority: 'critical',
      message: `${equipment} pressure ${pressure} PSI exceeds safe limit ${maxPressure} PSI`
    })
  }
})

// Immediately respond to leak detection
gas.leaksDetected(async ({ location, concentration, severity }) => {
  if (severity === 'high') {
    await gas.adjustValve({
      location,
      position: 0,
      reason: 'leak-detected-emergency-shutoff'
    })
    await notify({
      to: ['safety-coordinator', 'emergency-response'],
      priority: 'urgent',
      message: `Gas leak detected at ${location} - ${concentration} PPM`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-adjust combustion based on oxygen levels
gas.combustionOptimized(async ({ equipment, oxygenLevel, targetOxygen }) => {
  const delta = oxygenLevel - targetOxygen
  if (Math.abs(delta) > 0.5) {
    await gas.adjustValve({
      equipment,
      adjustmentPercent: delta > 0 ? -2 : 2,
      reason: 'auto-combustion-tuning'
    })
  }
})
```
