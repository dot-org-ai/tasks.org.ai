# Adjust Temperature Controls Ovens Heating

> Business-as-Code definition for thermal equipment control and temperature management. Models the complete process of configuring, monitoring, and adjusting heating systems for industrial and commercial applications.

## Overview

Temperature control adjustment involves setting and maintaining precise thermal conditions for ovens, furnaces, kilns, and other heating equipment. This definition exposes actions for temperature programming, real-time adjustment, and safety monitoring to ensure optimal heating performance across manufacturing and food service operations.

## Actors

| Actor | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ProductionOperator | Operates heating equipment during manufacturing processes |
| MaintenanceTechnician | Services and calibrates temperature control systems |
| QualityInspector | Verifies temperature accuracy for product specifications |
| ProcessEngineer | Defines temperature profiles for specific operations |
| EnergyManager | Monitors energy consumption and efficiency |
| SafetyOfficer | Ensures thermal equipment meets safety standards |

## Roles

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { adjustTemperatureControlsOvensHeating } from '@headlessly/adjust-temperature-controls-ovens-heating'

const thermal = adjustTemperatureControlsOvensHeating()

// Set target temperature for industrial oven
await thermal.setTemperature({
  equipmentId: 'OVEN-301',
  targetTemp: 350,
  units: 'celsius',
  setBy: 'operator-042'
})

// Program multi-step heat treatment profile
await thermal.programProfile({
  equipmentId: 'FURNACE-12',
  profile: [
    { step: 1, temp: 200, rampRate: 5, holdTime: 60 },
    { step: 2, temp: 450, rampRate: 3, holdTime: 120 },
    { step: 3, temp: 100, rampRate: -2, holdTime: 30 }
  ],
  programmedBy: 'process-engineer-008'
})

// Configure safety alarm thresholds
await thermal.setAlarms({
  equipmentId: 'KILN-7',
  highLimit: 800,
  lowLimit: 150,
  tolerance: 10
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on temperature alarm
thermal.alarmTriggered(async ({ equipmentId, currentTemp, threshold, type }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'production-supervisors',
    message: `${type} alarm on ${equipmentId}: ${currentTemp}°C`,
    priority: 'critical'
  })

  // Trigger safety shutdown if needed
  if (currentTemp > 900) {
    await thermal.setTemperature({ equipmentId, targetTemp: 0 })
  }
})

// Log temperature stabilization for quality records
thermal.temperatureStabilized(async ({ equipmentId, targetTemp, actualTemp }) => {
  await qualityLog.record({
    equipment: equipmentId,
    event: 'temperature-stable',
    target: targetTemp,
    actual: actualTemp,
    timestamp: new Date()
  })
})
```
