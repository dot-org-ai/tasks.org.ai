## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { adjustOfficeEquipmentEnsureProper } from '@headlessly/adjust-office-equipment-ensure-proper'

const office = adjustOfficeEquipmentEnsureProper()

// Inspect reported equipment issue
const inspection = await office.inspectDevice({
  equipmentId: 'PRINTER-3RDFLOOR-02',
  ticketId: 'TICKET-20260215-034',
  symptoms: ['Paper jams frequently', 'Print quality poor']
})

// Diagnose the problem
const diagnosis = await office.diagnoseIssue({
  inspectionId: inspection.id,
  tests: ['paper-feed', 'roller-condition', 'toner-level', 'fuser-temperature']
})

// Adjust settings to resolve issue
if (diagnosis.issue === 'incorrect-paper-settings') {
  await office.adjustSettings({
    equipmentId: 'PRINTER-3RDFLOOR-02',
    settings: {
      paperWeight: 'heavy',
      fuserTemperature: 'high',
      rollerPressure: 'increased'
    }
  })
}

// Test after adjustment
const test = await office.testOperation({
  equipmentId: 'PRINTER-3RDFLOOR-02',
  testPrint: true
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify user when issue is diagnosed
office.issueDiagnosed(async ({ ticketId, diagnosis }) => {
  const ticket = await getTicket({ ticketId })
  await notify({
    to: ticket.userId,
    message: `Your equipment issue has been diagnosed: ${diagnosis.description}`
  })
})

// Auto-schedule preventive maintenance after service
office.serviceDocumented(async ({ equipmentId, serviceType }) => {
  if (serviceType === 'Repair') {
    await scheduleMaintenanceTask({
      equipmentId,
      type: 'Preventive Inspection',
      dueDate: add30Days(new Date())
    })
  }
})
```
