# Adjust Equipment Controls Regulate Coolant

> Business-as-Code definition for coolant flow regulation. Models the adjustment of controls on industrial machinery, HVAC systems, and manufacturing equipment to optimize cooling performance.

## Overview

Coolant flow regulation involves monitoring equipment temperature, adjusting valve positions, modifying pump speeds, maintaining coolant levels, troubleshooting cooling failures, and ensuring optimal heat transfer. This definition exposes actions for flow control, temperature management, and system optimization.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { adjustEquipmentControlsRegulateCoolant } from '@headlessly/adjust-equipment-controls-regulate-coolant'

const coolant = adjustEquipmentControlsRegulateCoolant()

// Monitor CNC machine temperature
const temp = await coolant.monitorTemperature({
  equipment: 'cnc-mill-04',
  sensors: ['spindle-temp', 'coolant-supply-temp', 'coolant-return-temp'],
  interval: 'continuous'
})

// Adjust valve to increase cooling
await coolant.adjustValve({
  valveId: 'coolant-valve-04a',
  position: 75,
  reason: 'elevated-spindle-temperature',
  targetTemp: 85
})

// Set pump speed for optimal flow
await coolant.setPumpSpeed({
  pumpId: 'coolant-pump-04',
  speed: 1800,
  flowRate: 15,
  pressure: 40
})

// Maintain coolant level
await coolant.maintainLevel({
  loopId: 'cnc-mill-04-loop',
  currentLevel: 85,
  targetLevel: 95,
  additive: 'rust-inhibitor'
})

// Optimize flow for efficiency
await coolant.optimizeFlow({
  equipment: 'cnc-mill-04',
  objective: 'minimize-temperature-variance',
  constraints: { maxPumpSpeed: 2000, maxPressure: 50 }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert when temperature exceeds safe limits
coolant.temperatureMonitored(async ({ equipment, temperature }) => {
  if (temperature > 95) {
    await coolant.troubleshootCooling({
      equipment,
      issue: 'over-temperature',
      priority: 'critical'
    })
    await notify({
      to: 'equipment-operator',
      priority: 'urgent',
      message: `${equipment} temperature ${temperature}F exceeds safe limit`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-adjust valve based on temperature
coolant.temperatureMonitored(async ({ equipment, temperature, targetTemp }) => {
  if (Math.abs(temperature - targetTemp) > 5) {
    const delta = temperature - targetTemp
    await coolant.adjustValve({
      equipment,
      adjustmentPercent: delta > 0 ? 10 : -10,
      reason: 'auto-temperature-regulation'
    })
  }
})
```
