## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { prepareMedicalSuppliesEquipmentUse } from '@headlessly/prepare-medical-supplies-equipment-use'

const supplies = prepareMedicalSuppliesEquipmentUse()

// Check inventory across locations
const inventory = await supplies.checkInventory({
  location: 'floor-3-med-room',
  categories: ['iv-supplies', 'wound-care', 'ppe']
})

// Inspect supplies for expiration and damage
const inspection = await supplies.inspectSupplies({
  location: 'floor-3-med-room',
  expirationThreshold: 30 // days
})

// Quarantine expired items
if (inspection.expiredItems.length > 0) {
  await supplies.quarantineItems({
    itemIds: inspection.expiredItems,
    reason: 'expired',
    disposalMethod: 'regulated-waste'
  })
}

// Replenish low stock items
for (const item of inventory.lowStockItems) {
  await supplies.replenishStock({
    itemId: item.id,
    quantity: item.parLevel - item.currentLevel,
    urgency: item.critical ? 'stat' : 'routine'
  })
}

// Assemble procedure-specific supply kit
const kit = await supplies.assembleKit({
  kitType: 'central-line-insertion',
  items: [
    { itemId: 'chlorhexidine-swab', quantity: 3 },
    { itemId: 'sterile-drape', quantity: 2 },
    { itemId: 'lidocaine-1pct', quantity: 1 }
  ]
})

// Distribute to clinical location
await supplies.distributeSupplies({
  kitId: kit.id,
  destination: 'icu-bed-12',
  requestedBy: 'nurse-jones',
  urgency: 'stat'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-replenish when stock falls below par level
supplies.inventoryChecked(async ({ location, lowStockItems }) => {
  for (const item of lowStockItems) {
    if (item.currentLevel < item.reorderPoint) {
      await supplies.replenishStock({
        itemId: item.id,
        quantity: item.parLevel - item.currentLevel
      })
    }
  }
})

// Alert on approaching expirations
supplies.suppliesInspected(async ({ location, expiringItems }) => {
  if (expiringItems.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'supply-team',
      message: `${expiringItems.length} items expiring in ${location}`
    })
  }
})
```
