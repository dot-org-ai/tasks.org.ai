## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { storeItems } from '@headlessly/store-items'

const storage = storeItems()

// Accept equipment for storage
const item = await storage.intakeItem({
  description: 'Conference room projector',
  owner: 'marketing-dept',
  category: 'av-equipment',
  serialNumber: 'PRJ-8471',
  expectedDuration: '6-months'
})

// Inspect condition at intake
await storage.inspectCondition({
  itemId: item.id,
  phase: 'intake',
  condition: 'good',
  notes: 'Minor scuff on housing, fully functional',
  photos: ['intake-001.jpg', 'intake-002.jpg']
})

// Assign storage location
const location = await storage.assignLocation({
  itemId: item.id,
  requirements: { climate: 'standard', security: 'medium' },
  preferredZone: 'building-a'
})

// Place in storage
await storage.placeInStorage({
  itemId: item.id,
  locationId: location.id,
  handledBy: 'worker-1847',
  timestamp: new Date()
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Automatically label items after intake
storage.itemIntaken(async ({ itemId, serialNumber }) => {
  await storage.labelItem({
    itemId,
    barcodeType: 'qr-code',
    includeSerial: true
  })
})

// Alert owner when retrieval request is fulfilled
storage.itemRetrieved(async ({ itemId, owner, requestId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: owner,
    message: `Your stored item is ready for pickup`,
    requestId,
    pickupLocation: 'receiving-desk'
  })
})
```
