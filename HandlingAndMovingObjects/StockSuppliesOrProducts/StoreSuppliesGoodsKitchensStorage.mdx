## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { storeSuppliesGoodsKitchensStorage } from '@headlessly/store-supplies-goods-kitchens-storage'

const kitchen = storeSuppliesGoodsKitchensStorage()

// Receive morning produce delivery
const delivery = await kitchen.receiveDelivery({
  vendorId: 'SYSCO-4821',
  deliveryId: 'DEL-29384',
  items: [
    { product: 'romaine-lettuce', quantity: 12, unit: 'case', temp: 38 },
    { product: 'chicken-breast', quantity: 40, unit: 'lb', temp: 35 },
    { product: 'tomatoes-roma', quantity: 8, unit: 'case', temp: 42 }
  ]
})

// Check quality on arrival
await kitchen.checkQuality({
  deliveryId: delivery.id,
  checks: [
    { product: 'romaine-lettuce', freshness: 'good', damage: 'none' },
    { product: 'chicken-breast', temp: 35, packaging: 'sealed' },
    { product: 'tomatoes-roma', ripeness: 'optimal', bruising: 'minimal' }
  ]
})

// Label with dates
await kitchen.labelItems({
  deliveryId: delivery.id,
  receivedDate: new Date(),
  useByDays: { 'romaine-lettuce': 7, 'chicken-breast': 3, 'tomatoes-roma': 5 }
})

// Store in appropriate zones
await kitchen.assignZone({
  deliveryId: delivery.id,
  assignments: [
    { product: 'romaine-lettuce', zone: 'walk-in-cooler-1' },
    { product: 'chicken-breast', zone: 'meat-cooler' },
    { product: 'tomatoes-roma', zone: 'produce-cooler' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-rotate stock when new items are stored
kitchen.zoneAssigned(async ({ deliveryId, assignments }) => {
  for (const item of assignments) {
    await kitchen.storeByFIFO({
      product: item.product,
      zone: item.zone,
      placement: 'back-of-shelf'
    })
  }
})

// Alert when temperature is out of safe range
kitchen.temperatureMonitored(async ({ zone, temp, safeRange }) => {
  if (temp < safeRange.min || temp > safeRange.max) {
    await notify({
      to: 'storage-manager',
      priority: 'urgent',
      message: `Temperature violation in ${zone}: ${temp}F (safe: ${safeRange.min}-${safeRange.max}F)`
    })
  }
})
```
