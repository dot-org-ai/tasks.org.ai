## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { stockMedicalPatientCareSupplies } from '@headlessly/stock-medical-patient-care-supplies'

const supplies = stockMedicalPatientCareSupplies()

// Receive shipment of surgical supplies
const shipment = await supplies.receiveShipment({
  vendorId: 'MEDLINE-001',
  poNumber: 'PO-48392',
  items: [
    { sku: 'SG-9274', quantity: 100, lot: 'L2048', expiration: '2028-06-15' },
    { sku: 'GL-2845', quantity: 500, lot: 'L9482', expiration: '2027-12-01' }
  ]
})

// Stock items on shelves
await supplies.stockShelves({
  shipmentId: shipment.id,
  locations: [
    { sku: 'SG-9274', location: 'A-12-3' },
    { sku: 'GL-2845', location: 'B-05-1' }
  ]
})

// Set par levels for automated reordering
await supplies.setParLevels({
  sku: 'SG-9274',
  minQuantity: 50,
  maxQuantity: 200,
  reorderQuantity: 150
})

// Fulfill department supply request
await supplies.fulfillRequisition({
  requisitionId: 'REQ-8471',
  department: 'OR-3',
  items: [
    { sku: 'SG-9274', quantity: 25 },
    { sku: 'GL-2845', quantity: 50 }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-reorder when inventory falls below par level
supplies.cycleCounted(async ({ sku, quantity, parLevel }) => {
  if (quantity < parLevel.minQuantity) {
    await supplies.reorderSupplies({
      sku,
      quantity: parLevel.reorderQuantity
    })
  }
})

// Alert supply team when items are nearing expiration
supplies.expirationChecked(async ({ items }) => {
  const expiringSoon = items.filter(i => i.daysUntilExpiration <= 30)
  if (expiringSoon.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'supply-team',
      message: `${expiringSoon.length} items expiring within 30 days`,
      items: expiringSoon
    })
  }
})
```
