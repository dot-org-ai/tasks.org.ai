## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { stockServingStationsDiningAreas } from '@headlessly/stock-serving-stations-dining-areas'

const service = stockServingStationsDiningAreas()

// Prepare food items for lunch buffet
const prep = await service.prepareFoodItems({
  mealPeriod: 'lunch',
  items: [
    { dish: 'grilled-chicken', quantity: 50, pan: 'full-steam' },
    { dish: 'roasted-vegetables', quantity: 30, pan: 'half-steam' },
    { dish: 'pasta-primavera', quantity: 40, pan: 'full-steam' }
  ]
})

// Transport to serving station
await service.transportToStation({
  prepId: prep.id,
  station: 'main-buffet',
  time: '11:15'
})

// Stock buffet line
await service.stockBuffet({
  station: 'main-buffet',
  items: prep.items,
  labelTemperatures: true,
  arrangementStyle: 'flow-layout'
})

// Replenish utensils and supplies
await service.replenishSupplies({
  station: 'main-buffet',
  supplies: [
    { item: 'serving-spoons', quantity: 12 },
    { item: 'dinner-plates', quantity: 50 },
    { item: 'napkins', quantity: 200 }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-replenish when items fall below par level
service.stockRotated(async ({ station, item, currentLevel, parLevel }) => {
  if (currentLevel < parLevel.minimum) {
    await service.replenishSupplies({
      station,
      supplies: [{ item, quantity: parLevel.target - currentLevel }]
    })
  }
})

// Alert when temperature is out of safe range
service.temperaturesChecked(async ({ station, item, temp, range }) => {
  if (temp < range.min || temp > range.max) {
    await notify({
      to: 'foh-manager',
      priority: 'urgent',
      message: `Temperature violation: ${item} at ${temp}F (safe: ${range.min}-${range.max}F)`,
      station
    })
  }
})
```
