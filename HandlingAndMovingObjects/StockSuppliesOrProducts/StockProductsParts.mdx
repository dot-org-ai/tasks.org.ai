## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { stockProductsParts } from '@headlessly/stock-products-parts'

const inventory = stockProductsParts()

// Receive shipment from supplier
const shipment = await inventory.receiveShipment({
  supplierId: 'SUP-2847',
  poNumber: 'PO-19283',
  items: [
    { sku: 'PART-4821', quantity: 500, lot: 'L9482' },
    { sku: 'PART-5293', quantity: 250, lot: 'L9483' }
  ]
})

// Assign storage locations
await inventory.assignLocation({
  shipmentId: shipment.id,
  assignments: [
    { sku: 'PART-4821', location: 'A-12-05' },
    { sku: 'PART-5293', location: 'B-08-12' }
  ]
})

// Stock shelves
await inventory.stockShelves({
  shipmentId: shipment.id,
  stockedBy: 'user-1847',
  timestamp: new Date()
})

// Pick order for production
await inventory.pickOrder({
  pickListId: 'PL-8471',
  items: [
    { sku: 'PART-4821', quantity: 50, location: 'A-12-05' },
    { sku: 'PART-5293', quantity: 25, location: 'B-08-12' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Trigger replenishment when stock falls below reorder point
inventory.orderPicked(async ({ sku, newStockLevel, reorderPoint }) => {
  if (newStockLevel <= reorderPoint) {
    await inventory.triggerReplenishment({
      sku,
      quantity: reorderPoint * 2
    })
  }
})

// Notify warehouse team when shipment is ready for stocking
inventory.locationAssigned(async ({ shipmentId, items }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'warehouse-team',
    message: `Shipment ${shipmentId} ready for stocking`,
    itemCount: items.length
  })
})
```
