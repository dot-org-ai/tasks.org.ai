# Drill Holes Parts Equipment Materials

> Business-as-Code definition for drilling holes in parts, equipment, or materials during manufacturing and fabrication. Models the complete drilling workflow from work order processing through quality inspection.

## Overview

Drilling holes in parts, equipment, or materials involves creating precise openings in metal, plastic, composite, and other materials for assembly, fastening, and functionality. This definition exposes actions for setup, drilling operations, deburring, and inspection, with events for production tracking and quality control.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { drillHolesPartsEquipmentMaterials } from '@headlessly/drill-holes-parts-equipment-materials'

const drilling = drillHolesPartsEquipmentMaterials()

// Load work order for drilling mounting plate
const workOrder = await drilling.loadWorkOrder({
  orderNumber: 'WO-2026-1234',
  partNumber: 'PLATE-A-100',
  quantity: 50,
  holes: [
    { id: 'H1', x: 25, y: 25, diameter: 0.25, depth: 'through', tolerance: 0.005 },
    { id: 'H2', x: 75, y: 25, diameter: 0.25, depth: 'through', tolerance: 0.005 },
    { id: 'H3', x: 25, y: 75, diameter: 0.25, depth: 'through', tolerance: 0.005 },
    { id: 'H4', x: 75, y: 75, diameter: 0.25, depth: 'through', tolerance: 0.005 }
  ],
  material: 'aluminum-6061',
  units: 'millimeters'
})

// Setup fixture and select tooling
await drilling.setupFixture({
  workOrderId: workOrder.id,
  fixtureType: 'grid-plate',
  clampingMethod: 'toe-clamps',
  workpiecePosition: 'centered'
})

const tooling = await drilling.selectTooling({
  material: 'aluminum-6061',
  holeDiameter: 0.25,
  depth: 10,
  bitType: 'HSS-twist-drill',
  speed: 3000,
  speedUnit: 'rpm',
  feed: 0.003,
  feedUnit: 'inches-per-revolution'
})

// Drill holes and inspect
const hole = await drilling.drillHole({
  workOrderId: workOrder.id,
  holeId: 'H1',
  toolingId: tooling.id
})

await drilling.deburHole({
  holeId: hole.id,
  method: 'chamfer-tool',
  edgeBreak: 0.010
})

const inspection = await drilling.inspectHole({
  holeId: hole.id,
  measuredDiameter: 0.2503,
  measuredPosition: { x: 25.002, y: 24.998 },
  concentricity: 0.002
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert when hole inspection fails
drilling.holeInspected(async ({ holeId, workOrderId, passed, measurements }) => {
  if (!passed) {
    await notify({
      to: 'production-supervisor',
      priority: 'high',
      message: `Hole ${holeId} failed inspection on work order ${workOrderId}`,
      deviations: measurements.filter(m => !m.withinTolerance)
    })

    // Increment scrap count
    await updateWorkOrder({
      workOrderId,
      scrapCount: 1,
      reason: 'out-of-tolerance-hole'
    })
  }
})

// Track tool life and recommend replacement
drilling.holeDrilled(async ({ toolingId, holeCount }) => {
  const toolLife = await getToolLife(toolingId)

  if (holeCount >= toolLife.maxHoles * 0.9) {
    await notify({
      to: 'machine-operator',
      message: `Drill bit ${toolingId} approaching end of life (${holeCount}/${toolLife.maxHoles} holes)`,
      recommendation: 'Prepare replacement tool'
    })
  }
})
```
