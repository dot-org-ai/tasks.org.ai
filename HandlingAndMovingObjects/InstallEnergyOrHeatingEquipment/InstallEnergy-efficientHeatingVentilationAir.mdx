# Install Energy-Efficient Heating, Ventilation, or Air Conditioning (HVAC) Equipment

> Business-as-Code definition for energy-efficient HVAC equipment installation. Models the specification, placement, connection, and commissioning of high-efficiency heating, cooling, and ventilation systems.

## Overview

Installing energy-efficient HVAC equipment involves selecting ENERGY STAR or high-SEER-rated systems, preparing mounting locations, connecting refrigerant lines and ductwork, wiring controls, and commissioning the system for optimal performance. This definition covers heat pump installations, variable-speed air handlers, geothermal loop systems, and smart thermostat integration for residential and commercial buildings pursuing energy efficiency goals.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { installEnergyEfficientHeatingVentilationAir } from '@headlessly/install-energy-efficient-heating-ventilation-air'

const hvac = installEnergyEfficientHeatingVentilationAir()

// Perform load calculation
const load = await hvac.performLoadCalc({
  buildingId: 'BLDG-2024-0032',
  squareFeet: 2400,
  climateZone: '4A',
  insulationRValue: 38
})

// Select and mount equipment
await hvac.selectEquipment({
  loadId: load.id,
  type: 'heat-pump',
  seerRating: 20,
  hspfRating: 10,
  manufacturer: 'Carrier'
})

await hvac.mountEquipment({
  buildingId: 'BLDG-2024-0032',
  outdoorPad: 'concrete-level',
  indoorLocation: 'utility-closet'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-file rebate when system is commissioned
hvac.systemCommissioned(async ({ buildingId, seerRating, equipmentModel }) => {
  if (seerRating >= 16) {
    await hvac.fileRebate({
      buildingId,
      equipmentModel,
      utilityProgram: 'energy-efficiency-upgrade'
    })
  }
})

// Alert on commissioning failure
hvac.systemCommissioned(async ({ buildingId, passed, issues }) => {
  if (!passed) {
    await notify({
      to: 'design-engineer',
      message: `HVAC commissioning failed at ${buildingId}: ${issues.join(', ')}`
    })
  }
})
```
