## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { handleCargoFreightBaggage } from '@headlessly/handle-cargo-freight-baggage'

const cargo = handleCargoFreightBaggage()

// Receive an inbound shipment
const shipment = await cargo.receiveShipment({
  carrier: 'TransGlobal Logistics',
  trackingNumber: 'TGL-2026-887412',
  itemCount: 24,
  dock: 'Bay 14',
  manifestId: 'MAN-2026-04-15-014'
})

// Identify and stage each item
for (const item of shipment.items) {
  await cargo.identifyCargo({ itemId: item.id, scanType: 'barcode' })
  await cargo.stageFreight({ itemId: item.id, stagingArea: 'Zone C-3' })
}

// Dispatch for outbound transport
await cargo.dispatchShipment({
  shipmentId: shipment.id,
  outboundCarrier: 'Regional Express',
  destination: 'Distribution Center East'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert operations on damage detection
cargo.damageDetected(async ({ shipmentId, itemId, severity, description }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'claims-department',
    message: `Damage (${severity}) on item ${itemId} in shipment ${shipmentId}: ${description}`
  })
})

// Auto-route baggage when flight gate changes
cargo.baggageRouted(async ({ baggageTag, flightNumber, newGate }) => {
  await updateSortationSystem({
    baggageTag,
    destination: newGate,
    priority: 'high'
  })
})
```
