## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { packageMaterialsProducts } from '@headlessly/package-materials-products'

const packaging = packageMaterialsProducts()

// Create packaging order
const order = await packaging.createOrder({
  productIds: ['PROD-8472', 'PROD-8473', 'PROD-8474'],
  destination: 'warehouse-east',
  priority: 'standard',
  requiredBy: '2026-02-10'
})

// Select appropriate packaging materials
const selection = await packaging.selectPackaging({
  orderId: order.id,
  criteria: {
    size: 'large',
    strength: 'heavy-duty',
    weatherResistance: true
  }
})

// Prepare and package items
await packaging.prepareItems({
  orderId: order.id,
  grouping: 'by-fragility',
  inspection: true
})

await packaging.insertCushioning({
  orderId: order.id,
  material: 'bubble-wrap',
  coverage: 'full'
})

await packaging.placeItems({
  orderId: order.id,
  arrangement: 'heaviest-bottom',
  orientation: 'upright'
})

await packaging.applyLabeling({
  orderId: order.id,
  labels: {
    shipTo: 'Warehouse East, 123 Industrial Pkwy',
    shipFrom: 'Manufacturing Plant 7',
    handling: ['Fragile', 'Keep Dry', 'This Side Up'],
    weight: '45 lbs'
  }
})

const sealed = await packaging.sealPackage({
  orderId: order.id,
  method: 'tape-seal',
  verification: true
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-select packaging based on product dimensions
packaging.orderCreated(async ({ orderId, productIds }) => {
  const products = await getProducts(productIds)
  const dimensions = calculateTotalDimensions(products)

  await packaging.selectPackaging({
    orderId,
    criteria: {
      size: selectSizeForDimensions(dimensions),
      strength: selectStrengthForWeight(products.totalWeight)
    }
  })
})

// Alert if packaging order exceeds weight limit
packaging.itemsPlaced(async ({ orderId, totalWeight }) => {
  const MAX_WEIGHT = 70

  if (totalWeight > MAX_WEIGHT) {
    await notify({
      to: 'packaging-specialist',
      message: `Order ${orderId} exceeds weight limit: ${totalWeight} lbs > ${MAX_WEIGHT} lbs. Split required.`
    })
  }
})
```
