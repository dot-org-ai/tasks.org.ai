## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { packageProductsStorageShipment } from '@headlessly/package-products-storage-shipment'

const dualPackaging = packageProductsStorageShipment()

// Package products for initial storage
const storagePackage = await dualPackaging.packageForStorage({
  productIds: ['PROD-8271', 'PROD-8272'],
  packagingType: 'corrugated-box',
  stackable: true,
  protection: 'standard'
})

// Assign warehouse location and record inventory
const location = await dualPackaging.assignLocation({
  packageId: storagePackage.id,
  zone: 'A',
  aisle: 12,
  level: 3,
  criteria: ['accessibility', 'temperature-control']
})

await dualPackaging.recordInventory({
  packageId: storagePackage.id,
  locationId: location.id,
  productDetails: {
    sku: ['SKU-001', 'SKU-002'],
    quantity: 50,
    receivedDate: new Date().toISOString()
  }
})

// When shipment order received, prepare for delivery
const shipmentOrder = await getShipmentOrder('ORD-19283')

const retrieved = await dualPackaging.retrievePackage({
  orderId: shipmentOrder.id,
  locationId: location.id
})

const shipReady = await dualPackaging.prepareForShipment({
  packageId: retrieved.packageId,
  modifications: ['reinforce-corners', 'add-cushioning'],
  destination: shipmentOrder.destination
})

const label = await dualPackaging.generateShippingLabel({
  packageId: shipReady.packageId,
  orderId: shipmentOrder.id,
  carrier: 'fedex',
  service: 'ground'
})

await dualPackaging.releaseProduct({
  packageId: shipReady.packageId,
  carrier: 'fedex',
  pickupScheduled: '2026-02-06T10:00:00Z'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-assign storage location after packaging
dualPackaging.productPackaged(async ({ packageId }) => {
  const optimalLocation = await findOptimalStorageLocation({
    packageId,
    criteria: ['proximity-to-shipping', 'accessibility']
  })

  await dualPackaging.assignLocation({
    packageId,
    locationId: optimalLocation.id
  })

  await dualPackaging.recordInventory({
    packageId,
    locationId: optimalLocation.id
  })
})

// Alert when package requires shipment preparation
dualPackaging.packageRetrieved(async ({ packageId, orderId }) => {
  const order = await getShipmentOrder(orderId)

  if (order.priority === 'express') {
    await notify({
      to: 'fulfillment-specialist',
      message: `Express order ${orderId} retrieved for package ${packageId}. Prepare immediately.`
    })
  }

  await dualPackaging.prepareForShipment({
    packageId,
    modifications: selectModificationsForRoute(order.destination)
  })
})
```
