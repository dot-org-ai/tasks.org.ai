## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { packageFoodSupplies } from '@headlessly/package-food-supplies'

const foodPackaging = packageFoodSupplies()

// Prepare workspace and portion food
await foodPackaging.sanitizeWorkspace({
  area: 'line-3',
  protocol: 'food-grade-sanitation',
  verification: true
})

const portions = await foodPackaging.portionItem({
  foodItemId: 'FI-8472',
  servingSize: 12,
  unit: 'ounce',
  count: 100
})

// Package and seal
for (const portion of portions.items) {
  await foodPackaging.fillPackage({
    portionId: portion.id,
    containerType: 'plastic-tray',
    additionalItems: ['utensils', 'napkin']
  })

  const sealed = await foodPackaging.sealContainer({
    portionId: portion.id,
    sealType: 'heat-seal',
    temperature: 350,
    pressure: 40
  })

  await foodPackaging.attachLabel({
    packageId: sealed.id,
    nutritionFacts: {
      servingSize: '12 oz',
      calories: 420,
      protein: 28,
      carbs: 45,
      fat: 12
    },
    expirationDate: '2026-02-12',
    allergens: ['wheat', 'soy']
  })

  await foodPackaging.verifyIntegrity({
    packageId: sealed.id,
    checks: ['seal-strength', 'label-adhesion', 'container-integrity']
  })
}
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-label after sealing
foodPackaging.containerSealed(async ({ packageId, foodItemId }) => {
  const nutritionData = await getNutritionFacts(foodItemId)
  await foodPackaging.attachLabel({
    packageId,
    nutritionFacts: nutritionData,
    expirationDate: calculateExpiration(foodItemId)
  })
})

// Alert if seal integrity fails
foodPackaging.integrityVerified(async ({ packageId, passed, issues }) => {
  if (!passed) {
    await notify({
      to: 'food-safety-officer',
      message: `Package ${packageId} failed integrity check: ${issues.join(', ')}`
    })
    await quarantine({ packageId })
  } else {
    await foodPackaging.storePackage({ packageId })
  }
})
```
