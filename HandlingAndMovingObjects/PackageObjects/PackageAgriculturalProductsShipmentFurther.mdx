## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { packageAgriculturalProductsShipmentFurther } from '@headlessly/package-agricultural-products-shipment-further'

const agPackaging = packageAgriculturalProductsShipmentFurther()

// Grade incoming products
const grading = await agPackaging.gradeProduct({
  productType: 'apples',
  variety: 'honeycrisp',
  quantity: 500,
  criteria: ['size', 'color', 'blemishes', 'firmness']
})

// Select appropriate packaging
const container = await agPackaging.selectContainer({
  productType: 'apples',
  grade: grading.grade,
  destination: 'retail-distribution',
  weight: 40
})

// Execute packaging workflow
const batch = await agPackaging.fillPackage({
  gradingId: grading.id,
  containerId: container.id,
  count: 12,
  weight: 40
})

await agPackaging.applyLabel({
  batchId: batch.id,
  labelData: {
    product: 'Honeycrisp Apples',
    grade: 'Fancy',
    weight: '40 lbs',
    origin: 'Washington State',
    harvestDate: '2026-02-01',
    lot: 'LOT-2026-0205-HC'
  }
})

// Inspect and prepare for shipment
const inspection = await agPackaging.inspectPackage({
  batchId: batch.id,
  checks: ['label-accuracy', 'container-integrity', 'weight-compliance']
})

await agPackaging.palletizeShipment({
  batchIds: [batch.id],
  palletConfig: { layers: 5, boxesPerLayer: 10 }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-select container based on grading results
agPackaging.productGraded(async ({ productType, grade, quantity }) => {
  await agPackaging.selectContainer({
    productType,
    grade,
    destination: getDestinationForGrade(grade),
    weight: calculateContainerWeight(quantity)
  })
})

// Alert if inspection fails packaging standards
agPackaging.packageInspected(async ({ batchId, passed, issues }) => {
  if (!passed) {
    await notify({
      to: 'quality-grader',
      message: `Batch ${batchId} failed inspection: ${issues.join(', ')}`
    })
    await agPackaging.documentBatch({
      batchId,
      status: 'rejected',
      reason: issues[0]
    })
  }
})
```
