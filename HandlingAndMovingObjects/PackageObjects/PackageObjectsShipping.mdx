## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { packageObjectsShipping } from '@headlessly/package-objects-shipping'

const shipping = packageObjectsShipping()

// Fulfill customer order
const fulfillment = await shipping.fulfillOrder({
  orderId: 'ORD-28471',
  items: [
    { sku: 'SKU-001', quantity: 2 },
    { sku: 'SKU-002', quantity: 1 }
  ]
})

// Select carrier and packaging
const carrier = await shipping.selectCarrierService({
  orderId: fulfillment.orderId,
  destination: {
    address: '123 Main St',
    city: 'Seattle',
    state: 'WA',
    zip: '98101'
  },
  preferences: {
    speed: 'ground',
    insurance: true,
    signature: false
  }
})

const box = await shipping.selectBoxSize({
  orderId: fulfillment.orderId,
  itemDimensions: fulfillment.totalDimensions,
  cushioningSpace: 2
})

// Package and label
await shipping.wrapProtection({
  orderId: fulfillment.orderId,
  materials: ['bubble-wrap', 'packing-paper'],
  fragileItems: ['SKU-002']
})

await shipping.packItems({
  orderId: fulfillment.orderId,
  boxId: box.id,
  arrangement: 'heaviest-bottom'
})

const label = await shipping.generateLabel({
  orderId: fulfillment.orderId,
  carrierServiceId: carrier.id,
  returnAddress: true
})

// Schedule carrier pickup
await shipping.schedulePickup({
  carrierId: carrier.carrierId,
  pickupDate: '2026-02-06',
  packageCount: 1,
  totalWeight: box.weight
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-select carrier based on order attributes
shipping.orderFulfilled(async ({ orderId, destination, weight }) => {
  const carrierService = await selectOptimalCarrier({
    destination,
    weight,
    criteria: ['cost', 'speed', 'reliability']
  })

  await shipping.selectCarrierService({
    orderId,
    carrierServiceId: carrierService.id
  })
})

// Notify customer when label generated
shipping.labelGenerated(async ({ orderId, trackingNumber }) => {
  const order = await getOrder(orderId)

  await notify({
    to: order.customerEmail,
    subject: 'Your order has shipped',
    message: `Your order ${orderId} has been shipped. Track your package: ${trackingNumber}`,
    trackingLink: `https://track.carrier.com/${trackingNumber}`
  })
})
```
