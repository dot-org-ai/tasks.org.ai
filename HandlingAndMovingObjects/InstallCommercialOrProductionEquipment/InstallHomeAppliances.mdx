await appliances.deliverAppliance({
  orderId: 'DEL-2024-08831',
  model: 'Bosch-SHPM88Z75N',
  address: '425 Oak Lane',
  removeOld: true
})

await appliances.connectUtilities({

      model,
      serialNumber,
      purchaseDate: new Date().toISOString()
    })
  }
})

// Schedule haul-away for old appliance
appliances.applianceDelivered(async ({ orderId, removeOld, address }) => {
  if (removeOld) {
    await recycling.schedulePickup({
      orderId,
      address,
      applianceType: 'dishwasher',
