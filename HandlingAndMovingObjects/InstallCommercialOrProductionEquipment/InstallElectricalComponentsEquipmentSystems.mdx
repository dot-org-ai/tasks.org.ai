# Install Electrical Components, Equipment, or Systems

> Business-as-Code definition for electrical installation. Models the planning, wiring, mounting, termination, and testing of electrical components, panels, switchgear, lighting, and power distribution systems in commercial, industrial, and residential settings.

## Overview

Installing electrical components, equipment, or systems involves interpreting blueprints and wiring diagrams, pulling conductors through conduit and raceways, mounting panels, switchgear, and fixtures, terminating connections, and performing testing to verify code compliance and proper operation. This definition covers commercial lighting installations, industrial motor control center setups, residential panel upgrades, transformer installations, and emergency generator tie-ins.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { installElectricalComponentsEquipmentSystems } from '@headlessly/install-electrical-components-equipment-systems'

const electrical = installElectricalComponentsEquipmentSystems()

// Review drawings and pull permit
await electrical.reviewDrawings({
  projectId: 'ELEC-2024-0187',
  drawingSet: 'E-100-series',
  panels: ['MDP', 'LP-1', 'LP-2'],
  voltage: '480/277V-3Ph'
})

// Install conduit and pull wire
await electrical.installConduit({
  projectId: 'ELEC-2024-0187',
  runs: [
    { from: 'MDP', to: 'LP-1', type: 'EMT', size: '2-inch', length: 85 },
    { from: 'MDP', to: 'LP-2', type: 'EMT', size: '1.5-inch', length: 120 }
  ]
})

// Test completed circuits
const tests = await electrical.testCircuits({
  projectId: 'ELEC-2024-0187',
  panel: 'LP-1',
  tests: ['insulation-resistance-1000v', 'continuity', 'phase-rotation', 'ground-fault'],
  instrument: 'Fluke-1587'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Schedule inspection when testing is complete
electrical.circuitsTested(async ({ projectId, allPassed }) => {
  if (allPassed) {
    await inspections.schedule({
      projectId,
      type: 'electrical-rough-in',
      requestedDate: nextBusinessDay()
    })
  }
})

// Alert on failed test results
electrical.circuitsTested(async ({ projectId, failedCircuits }) => {
  if (failedCircuits.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'electrical-foreman',
      message: `Project ${projectId}: ${failedCircuits.length} circuits failed testing. Review required.`
    })
  }
})
```
