# Apply Decorative Masonry Finishes

> Business-as-Code definition for architectural masonry finishing and surface treatment. Models the complete process of applying decorative treatments to brick, stone, concrete, and block surfaces for aesthetic enhancement and protection in commercial and residential construction.

## Overview

Decorative masonry finishing involves applying specialized coatings, textures, and treatments to enhance appearance while protecting structural surfaces. This definition exposes actions for surface preparation, finish application, and quality verification across construction projects, restoration work, and architectural detailing.

## Actors

| Actor | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| MasonryContractor | Manages masonry finishing projects |
| FinishingCraftsman | Applies decorative treatments to surfaces |
| Architect | Specifies finish types and appearance standards |
| ProjectManager | Coordinates scheduling and quality |
| MaterialSupplier | Provides finishing products and technical support |
| BuildingInspector | Verifies compliance with building codes |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { applyDecorativeMasonryFinishes } from '@headlessly/apply-decorative-masonry-finishes'

const masonry = applyDecorativeMasonryFinishes()

// Prepare exterior brick wall for staining
await masonry.prepareSurface({
  surfaceId: 'WALL-EAST-FACADE',
  substrate: 'clay-brick',
  preparation: ['clean', 'pressure-wash', 'patch-defects'],
  dryTime: 48,
  preparedBy: 'crew-008'
})

// Apply decorative stain finish
await masonry.applyDecorativeFinish({
  surfaceId: 'WALL-EAST-FACADE',
  product: 'STAIN-TERRACOTTA-442',
  method: 'spray-application',
  coats: 2,
  coverage: '200-sqft-per-gallon',
  appliedBy: 'craftsman-042'
})

// Create textured surface pattern
await masonry.createTexture({
  surfaceId: 'COLUMN-DECORATIVE-12',
  technique: 'stipple-finish',
  pattern: 'medium-texture',
  depth: 'shallow',
  createdBy: 'texture-specialist-003'
})

// Inspect final coverage
const inspection = await masonry.inspectCoverage({
  surfaceId: 'WALL-EAST-FACADE',
  criteria: {
    uniformity: 'excellent',
    colorMatch: 'within-tolerance',
    defects: 'none'
  },
  inspectedBy: 'quality-inspector-008'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert when curing period complete
masonry.curingCompleted(async ({ surfaceId, finishDate, curingHours }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'project-manager',
    message: `Masonry finish on ${surfaceId} cured - ready for next phase`,
    priority: 'normal'
  })

  await schedule.update({
    surface: surfaceId,
    status: 'cured',
    nextPhase: 'available'
  })
})

// Log quality issues for warranty tracking
masonry.coverageInspected(async ({ surfaceId, quality, issues }) => {
  if (issues.length > 0) {
    await qualityLog.record({
      surface: surfaceId,
      event: 'coverage-defects',
      issues: issues,
      timestamp: new Date()
    })
  }
})
```
