## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { applyFinishesArtworkCraftsDisplays } from '@headlessly/apply-finishes-artwork-crafts-displays'

const finishing = applyFinishesArtworkCraftsDisplays()

// Assess oil painting for varnish
await finishing.assessSurface({
  pieceId: 'PAINTING-OIL-442',
  medium: 'oil-on-canvas',
  age: 'fully-cured',
  condition: 'excellent',
  assessedBy: 'finish-tech-008'
})

// Select archival varnish for protection
await finishing.selectFinish({
  pieceId: 'PAINTING-OIL-442',
  finishType: 'removable-varnish',
  product: 'GAMVAR-SATIN',
  sheen: 'satin',
  uv-protection: true,
  archival: true
})

// Apply varnish to acrylic painting
await finishing.applyTopCoat({
  pieceId: 'PAINTING-ACRYLIC-305',
  product: 'GOLDEN-POLYMER-VARNISH',
  method: 'brush-application',
  coats: 2,
  dryTimeBetween: 24,
  appliedBy: 'finish-tech-042'
})

// Monitor curing in controlled environment
const curing = await finishing.monitorCuring({
  pieceId: 'PAINTING-OIL-442',
  environment: {
    temperature: 70,
    humidity: 50,
    ventilation: 'good'
  },
  expectedCureTime: 72
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert when curing complete
finishing.curingCompleted(async ({ pieceId, finishDate, curingHours }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'artist',
    message: `Your artwork ${pieceId} finish has fully cured - ready for display`,
    priority: 'normal'
  })

  await inventory.update({
    piece: pieceId,
    status: 'finished',
    readyForDisplay: true
  })
})

// Schedule quality inspection after base coat
finishing.baseCoatApplied(async ({ pieceId, product, dryTime }) => {
  await schedule({
    task: 'quality-inspection',
    piece: pieceId,
    delay: dryTime,
    assignTo: 'quality-team'
  })
})
```
