## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { applyDecorativeTexturedFinishesCoverings } from '@headlessly/apply-decorative-textured-finishes-coverings'

const finishing = applyDecorativeTexturedFinishesCoverings()

// Prepare dining room walls for Venetian plaster
await finishing.prepareSurface({
  surfaceId: 'ROOM-DINING-442',
  substrate: 'drywall',
  preparation: ['fill-holes', 'sand-smooth', 'prime'],
  primerType: 'bonding-primer',
  preparedBy: 'prep-crew-008'
})

// Create knockdown texture
await finishing.createTexture({
  surfaceId: 'ROOM-LIVING-305',
  technique: 'knockdown',
  pattern: 'medium-random',
  aggregate: 'fine-sand',
  createdBy: 'texture-tech-042'
})

// Apply metallic faux finish
await finishing.applyDecorativeFinish({
  surfaceId: 'ACCENT-WALL-12',
  technique: 'metallic-faux',
  baseColor: 'charcoal',
  metallicColor: 'copper',
  method: 'trowel-application',
  appliedBy: 'faux-artist-003'
})

// Install designer wallcovering
await finishing.installWallcovering({
  surfaceId: 'MASTER-BEDROOM-WALL',
  product: 'WALLPAPER-DAMASK-8840',
  pattern: 'damask-medallion',
  repeatLength: 24,
  method: 'paste-the-wall',
  installedBy: 'wallcovering-installer-008'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert when surface ready for next phase
finishing.surfacePrepared(async ({ surfaceId, prepDate, readyFor }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'finishing-crew',
    message: `Surface ${surfaceId} prepped and ready for ${readyFor}`,
    priority: 'normal'
  })

  await schedule.update({
    surface: surfaceId,
    status: 'ready-for-finishing'
  })
})

// Log quality issues for rework
finishing.workmanshipInspected(async ({ surfaceId, quality, defects }) => {
  if (defects.length > 0) {
    await reworkLog.record({
      surface: surfaceId,
      event: 'quality-defects',
      issues: defects,
      requiresRework: true,
      timestamp: new Date()
    })
  }
})
```
