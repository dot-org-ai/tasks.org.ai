## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { positionConstructionExtractionEquipment } from '@headlessly/position-construction-extraction-equipment'

const positioning = positionConstructionExtractionEquipment()

// Plan excavator positioning for foundation work
const plan = await positioning.planPositioning({
  equipmentId: 'EXCAVATOR-CAT-336',
  siteId: 'PROJECT-2026-BLDG-A',
  workType: 'Foundation Excavation',
  operationalArea: {
    excavationDepth: 12,
    workRadius: 35,
    soilType: 'Clay with gravel'
  },
  duration: 5
})

// Assess ground conditions at equipment location
await positioning.assessGroundConditions({
  planId: plan.id,
  location: {
    latitude: 30.2672,
    longitude: -97.7431,
    elevation: 625
  },
  soilTests: {
    bearingCapacity: 4500,
    compaction: 95,
    moisture: 12
  },
  recommendation: 'Adequate bearing capacity, proceed with positioning'
})

// Transport equipment to site
await positioning.transportEquipment({
  equipmentId: 'EXCAVATOR-CAT-336',
  origin: 'Equipment Yard - South',
  destination: plan.siteId,
  transport: 'Lowboy Trailer',
  route: 'Via Highway 71 to site access road',
  estimatedArrival: '2026-02-21T08:00:00Z'
})

// Position equipment at operational location
await positioning.positionEquipment({
  planId: plan.id,
  equipmentId: 'EXCAVATOR-CAT-336',
  finalLocation: {
    latitude: 30.2672,
    longitude: -97.7431,
    orientation: 145,
    levelingStatus: 'Tracks level, verified with digital level'
  },
  operator: 'OPERATOR-CE-18'
})

// Configure equipment for operation
await positioning.configureSetup({
  equipmentId: 'EXCAVATOR-CAT-336',
  setup: {
    bucket: '36-inch digging bucket',
    counterweight: 'Standard configuration',
    outriggers: 'Not applicable',
    fuelLevel: 95,
    hydraulicPressure: 3500
  }
})

// Establish safety zones
await positioning.establishSafetyZones({
  equipmentId: 'EXCAVATOR-CAT-336',
  zones: [
    { type: 'Swing Radius', distance: 40, marking: 'Orange cones and caution tape' },
    { type: 'Load Drop', distance: 25, marking: 'No-entry signage' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on unsuitable ground conditions
positioning.groundConditionsAssessed(async ({ bearingCapacity, required, location }) => {
  if (bearingCapacity < required) {
    await notify({
      to: 'site-engineer',
      priority: 'high',
      message: `Ground bearing capacity ${bearingCapacity} psf below required ${required} psf at ${location.latitude}, ${location.longitude}`
    })
  }
})

// Track equipment utilization
positioning.setupConfigured(async ({ equipmentId, siteId, startTime }) => {
  await analytics.track({
    event: 'Equipment Operational',
    equipmentId,
    siteId,
    startTime,
    timestamp: new Date()
  })
})
```
