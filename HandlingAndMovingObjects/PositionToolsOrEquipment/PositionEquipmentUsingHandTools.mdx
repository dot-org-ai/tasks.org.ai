## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { positionEquipmentUsingHandTools } from '@headlessly/position-equipment-using-hand-tools'

const positioning = positionEquipmentUsingHandTools()

// Create positioning job for industrial compressor
const job = await positioning.createPositioningJob({
  equipmentId: 'COMPRESSOR-ROTARY-08',
  location: 'Building C - Mechanical Room 2',
  weight: 3850,
  dimensions: { length: 96, width: 48, height: 72 },
  placementSpec: 'INSTALL-SPEC-CR-08-REV-B',
  scheduledDate: '2026-02-24'
})

// Select tools for positioning operation
await positioning.selectTools({
  jobId: job.id,
  tools: [
    { type: 'Hydraulic Jack', capacity: 5000, quantity: 2, reason: 'Lift and position' },
    { type: 'Pry Bar', length: 60, quantity: 2, reason: 'Fine positioning' },
    { type: 'Spirit Level', length: 48, quantity: 1, reason: 'Level verification' },
    { type: 'Impact Wrench', drive: '3/4 inch', quantity: 1, reason: 'Anchor bolt installation' },
    { type: 'Forklift', capacity: 6000, quantity: 1, reason: 'Initial placement' }
  ]
})

// Prepare equipment for positioning
await positioning.prepareEquipment({
  jobId: job.id,
  preparation: {
    rigging: '4-point lift sling, 2-inch nylon webbing',
    clearance: 'Verified overhead and side clearance',
    foundation: 'Concrete pad level and cured',
    anchorBolts: 'Installed and positioned per drawing'
  }
})

// Position equipment using selected tools
await positioning.positionEquipment({
  jobId: job.id,
  procedure: [
    { step: 1, tool: 'Forklift', action: 'Lift and transport to mechanical room' },
    { step: 2, tool: 'Forklift', action: 'Lower onto concrete pad, approximately positioned' },
    { step: 3, tool: 'Hydraulic Jack', action: 'Lift south end 2 inches for bolt alignment' },
    { step: 4, tool: 'Pry Bar', action: 'Shift 1/4 inch east to align mounting holes' },
    { step: 5, tool: 'Spirit Level', action: 'Check level in both directions' },
    { step: 6, tool: 'Hydraulic Jack', action: 'Fine adjust height for level' }
  ],
  technician: 'TECH-INST-24'
})

// Verify final position
const verification = await positioning.verifyPosition({
  jobId: job.id,
  checks: [
    { parameter: 'Level Longitudinal', measurement: '0.010 inch in 8 feet', tolerance: '0.015 inch', status: 'Pass' },
    { parameter: 'Level Transverse', measurement: '0.008 inch in 4 feet', tolerance: '0.015 inch', status: 'Pass' },
    { parameter: 'Anchor Alignment', measurement: 'All 8 bolts aligned', tolerance: 'All bolts', status: 'Pass' },
    { parameter: 'Clearance', measurement: '18 inches all sides', tolerance: '12 inches minimum', status: 'Pass' }
  ]
})

// Secure equipment in position
await positioning.secureEquipment({
  jobId: job.id,
  fastening: [
    { type: 'Anchor Bolt', size: '3/4-10 x 12', quantity: 8, torque: 150, tool: 'Impact Wrench' },
    { type: 'Leveling Pad', location: 'All four corners', material: 'Neoprene', thickness: 0.25 }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on positioning difficulty
positioning.equipmentPositioned(async ({ jobId, procedure, attempts }) => {
  if (attempts > 2) {
    await notify({
      to: 'installation-engineer',
      priority: 'medium',
      message: `Equipment positioning job ${jobId} required ${attempts} attempts, review procedure`
    })
  }
})

// Track tool utilization
positioning.toolsSelected(async ({ tools, jobId }) => {
  for (const tool of tools) {
    await analytics.track({
      event: 'Tool Usage',
      toolType: tool.type,
      jobId,
      capacity: tool.capacity,
      timestamp: new Date()
    })
  }
})
```
