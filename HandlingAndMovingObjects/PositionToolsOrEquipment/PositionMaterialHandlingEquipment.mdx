# Position Material Handling Equipment

> Business-as-Code definition for positioning material handling equipment in production and warehouse environments. Models equipment placement, traffic flow optimization, and utilization tracking.

## Overview

Positioning material handling equipment involves strategic placement of forklifts, conveyors, carts, and lifting devices to optimize material flow, minimize congestion, and ensure safe operations. This definition exposes actions for equipment positioning, events for workflow automation, and searches for tracking equipment locations and utilization.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { positionMaterialHandlingEquipment } from '@headlessly/position-material-handling-equipment'

const equipmentPositioning = positionMaterialHandlingEquipment()

// Plan equipment placement for warehouse expansion
const plan = await equipmentPositioning.planEquipmentPlacement({
  facilityArea: 'Warehouse Zone C',
  equipment: [
    { type: 'Forklift', quantity: 4, capacity: 5000 },
    { type: 'Order Picker', quantity: 2, liftHeight: 30 },
    { type: 'Pallet Jack', quantity: 8, capacity: 5500 },
    { type: 'Reach Truck', quantity: 2, liftHeight: 40 }
  ],
  operatingHours: '24/7',
  shiftOverlap: 1
})

// Analyze traffic flow patterns
await equipmentPositioning.analyzeTrafficFlow({
  planId: plan.id,
  analysis: {
    primaryAisles: ['Main North-South', 'Cross Aisle A', 'Cross Aisle B'],
    congestionPoints: ['Shipping Dock 3', 'Receiving Area'],
    peakHours: ['08:00-10:00', '14:00-16:00'],
    averageTrips: 145,
    bottlenecks: ['Narrow access to Row 12-15'],
    recommendation: 'Position Order Pickers near high-volume pick zones, Forklifts near docks'
  }
})

// Position equipment at operational location
await equipmentPositioning.positionEquipment({
  planId: plan.id,
  placements: [
    { equipmentId: 'FORKLIFT-42', location: 'Shipping Dock 3 - West Side', assignment: 'Loading Operations' },
    { equipmentId: 'FORKLIFT-43', location: 'Receiving Area - North End', assignment: 'Unloading Operations' },
    { equipmentId: 'ORDERPICK-18', location: 'Row 8 - Pick Zone A', assignment: 'High-Volume Picks' },
    { equipmentId: 'REACH-TRUCK-09', location: 'Row 15 - High Bay', assignment: 'Upper Level Replenishment' }
  ]
})

// Establish parking zones for idle equipment
await equipmentPositioning.establishParkingZones({
  facilityArea: 'Warehouse Zone C',
  parkingZones: [
    { id: 'PARK-C1', location: 'South Wall', capacity: 6, equipmentType: 'Forklift', chargingStations: 4 },
    { id: 'PARK-C2', location: 'East Corner', capacity: 4, equipmentType: 'Order Picker', chargingStations: 2 },
    { id: 'PARK-C3', location: 'Break Room Adjacent', capacity: 10, equipmentType: 'Pallet Jack', chargingStations: 0 }
  ],
  rules: 'Equipment must be parked in designated zones during breaks and shift changes'
})

// Monitor equipment utilization
const utilization = await equipmentPositioning.monitorUtilization({
  facilityArea: 'Warehouse Zone C',
  period: '2026-02-24',
  metrics: [
    { equipmentId: 'FORKLIFT-42', operatingTime: 7.5, idleTime: 0.5, trips: 42, efficiency: 94 },
    { equipmentId: 'FORKLIFT-43', operatingTime: 6.8, idleTime: 1.2, trips: 38, efficiency: 85 },
    { equipmentId: 'ORDERPICK-18', operatingTime: 7.2, idleTime: 0.8, trips: 68, efficiency: 90 },
    { equipmentId: 'REACH-TRUCK-09', operatingTime: 5.5, idleTime: 2.5, trips: 24, efficiency: 69 }
  ]
})

// Optimize layout based on utilization data
await equipmentPositioning.optimizeLayout({
  facilityArea: 'Warehouse Zone C',
  optimizations: [
    { equipmentId: 'REACH-TRUCK-09', action: 'Relocate', newLocation: 'Row 12 - Closer to Replenishment Staging', reason: 'Reduce travel time' },
    { equipmentType: 'Pallet Jack', action: 'Redistribute', plan: 'Move 2 units from Zone C to Zone B for better balance' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on low equipment utilization
equipmentPositioning.utilizationMonitored(async ({ equipmentId, efficiency, idleTime }) => {
  if (efficiency < 70 || idleTime > 2.0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'equipment-coordinator',
      priority: 'medium',
      message: `Equipment ${equipmentId} showing low utilization: ${efficiency}% efficiency, ${idleTime} hours idle`
    })
  }
})

// Track congestion patterns for planning
equipmentPositioning.trafficFlowAnalyzed(async ({ congestionPoints, peakHours, bottlenecks }) => {
  if (bottlenecks && bottlenecks.length > 0) {
    await analytics.track({
      event: 'Traffic Congestion Analysis',
      congestionPoints: congestionPoints.length,
      peakHours: peakHours.join(', '),
      bottlenecks: bottlenecks.join(', '),
      timestamp: new Date()
    })
  }
})

// Auto-optimize during off-hours
equipmentPositioning.layoutOptimized(async ({ facilityArea, optimizations }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'warehouse-manager',
    message: `Equipment layout optimized in ${facilityArea}: ${optimizations.length} changes implemented`
  })
})
```
