## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { setUpClassroomMaterialsEquipment } from '@headlessly/set-up-classroom-materials-equipment'

const classroom = setUpClassroomMaterialsEquipment()

// Arrange a classroom for a science lab
const layout = await classroom.arrangeClassroom({
  roomId: 'SCI-204',
  layoutType: 'lab-stations',
  stations: 8,
  date: '2026-03-15'
})

// Configure equipment at each station
await classroom.configureEquipment({
  roomId: 'SCI-204',
  equipment: [
    { type: 'microscope', quantity: 8, calibrated: true },
    { type: 'projector', source: 'laptop-hdmi' }
  ]
})

// Verify the complete setup
const verification = await classroom.verifySetup({
  roomId: 'SCI-204',
  checklistId: 'biology-101-lab'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert when supplies are running low
classroom.materialShortageDetected(async ({ roomId, material, currentStock }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'supply-coordinator',
    message: `Low stock of ${material} in room ${roomId}: ${currentStock} remaining`
  })
})

// Auto-generate reset task after session ends
classroom.setupVerified(async ({ roomId, sessionEndTime }) => {
  await scheduleTask({
    action: 'resetClassroom',
    roomId,
    scheduledAt: sessionEndTime
  })
})
```
