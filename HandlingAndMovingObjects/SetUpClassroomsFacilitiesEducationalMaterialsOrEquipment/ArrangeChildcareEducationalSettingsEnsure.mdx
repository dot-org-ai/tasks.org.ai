# Arrange Childcare Educational Settings Ensure

> Business-as-Code definition for arranging childcare or educational settings to ensure the physical safety of children. Models the complete process of evaluating, configuring, and maintaining safe environments for young learners.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { arrangeChildcareEducationalSettingsEnsure } from '@headlessly/arrange-childcare-educational-settings-ensure'

const settings = arrangeChildcareEducationalSettingsEnsure()

// Assess room safety for toddlers
const assessment = await settings.assessRoomSafety({
  roomId: 'TODDLER-A',
  ageGroup: '18-36-months',
  inspector: 'safety-coordinator-01'
})

// Install required safety equipment
await settings.installSafetyEquipment({
  roomId: 'TODDLER-A',
  equipment: [
    { type: 'safety-gate', location: 'kitchen-entrance' },
    { type: 'outlet-cover', quantity: 12 },
    { type: 'corner-guard', location: 'activity-tables', quantity: 8 }
  ]
})

// Submit compliance report to licensing authority
await settings.submitComplianceReport({
  facilityId: 'sunshine-learning-center',
  inspectionId: assessment.id,
  regulatoryBody: 'state-childcare-licensing'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Escalate high-severity hazards immediately
settings.hazardIdentified(async ({ roomId, hazardType, severity }) => {
  if (severity === 'critical') {
    await notify({
      to: 'childcare-director',
      message: `Critical hazard in ${roomId}: ${hazardType} - room closed pending remediation`
    })
    await settings.configureLayout({ roomId, status: 'closed' })
  }
})

// Auto-schedule reassessment after equipment installation
settings.safetyEquipmentInstalled(async ({ roomId, installedAt }) => {
  await settings.scheduleReassessment({
    roomId,
    reassessDate: addDays(installedAt, 30)
  })
})
```
