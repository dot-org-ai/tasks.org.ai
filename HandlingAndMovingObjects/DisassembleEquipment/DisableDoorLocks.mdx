# Disable Door Locks

> Business-as-Code definition for door lock disabling. Models the assessment, bypassing, removal, and documentation of mechanical, electronic, and smart lock systems for authorized access, maintenance, rekeying, and emergency entry operations.

## Overview

Disabling door locks involves assessing the lock type and mechanism, selecting the appropriate bypass or removal technique, executing the disable operation without unnecessary damage, and documenting the action for security and compliance purposes.

| LockManufacturer | Provides technical data on lock mechanisms and authorized bypass methods |
| SecurityCompany | Monitors access events and verifies authorization for lock overrides |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { disableDoorLocks } from '@headlessly/disable-door-locks'

const locks = disableDoorLocks()

// Verify authorization and assess the lock
await locks.verifyAuthorization({
  requestId: 'LOCK-2024-0092',
  requestedBy: 'building-manager',
  property: '1420 Main St, Unit 3B',
  reason: 'tenant-lockout',
  authorizationType: 'property-owner-consent'
})

const assessment = await locks.assessLock({
  location: '1420 Main St, Unit 3B, Front Door',
  lockType: 'pin-tumbler-deadbolt',
  brand: 'Schlage',
  securityPins: 'spool-and-serrated'
})

// Disable the lock using the least-destructive method
await locks.disableLock({
  requestId: 'LOCK-2024-0092',
  method: 'single-pin-picking',
  tool: 'standard-hook-pick',
  tensionTool: 'top-of-keyway',
  destructive: false
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Schedule lock replacement after forced entry
locks.lockDisabled(async ({ requestId, location, destructive }) => {
  if (destructive) {
    await scheduling.createAppointment({
      type: 'lock-replacement',
      location,
      reference: requestId,
      priority: 'same-day'
    })
  }
})

// Notify security company of all lock disable events
locks.entryDocumented(async ({ requestId, location, method, authorizedBy }) => {
  await security.logEvent({
    type: 'lock-disabled',
    requestId,
    location,
    method,
    authorizedBy,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  })
})
```
