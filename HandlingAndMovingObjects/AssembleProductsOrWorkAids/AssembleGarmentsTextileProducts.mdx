## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { assembleGarmentsTextileProducts } from '@headlessly/assemble-garments-textile-products'

const garments = assembleGarmentsTextileProducts()

// Prepare materials for shirt assembly
await garments.prepareMaterials({
  productionOrder: 'PO-2026-450',
  style: 'dress-shirt',
  quantity: 100,
  materials: ['collar', 'front-panel', 'back-panel', 'sleeves', 'cuffs']
})

// Sew seams
await garments.sewSeams({
  productionOrder: 'PO-2026-450',
  seams: ['shoulder', 'side', 'sleeve'],
  stitchType: 'lock-stitch',
  seamAllowance: 0.5
})

// Attach trims
await garments.attachTrims({
  productionOrder: 'PO-2026-450',
  trims: [
    { type: 'button', quantity: 7, location: 'front-placket' },
    { type: 'label', location: 'collar' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Press garment after edges are finished
garments.edgesFinished(async ({ productionOrder, quantity }) => {
  await garments.pressGarment({
    productionOrder,
    temperature: 'cotton-setting',
    steam: true
  })
})

// Alert on quality failure
garments.qualityInspected(async ({ productionOrder, result }) => {
  if (result.defectRate > 0.05) {
    await notify({
      to: 'production-manager',
      message: `High defect rate on ${productionOrder}: ${(result.defectRate * 100).toFixed(1)}%`
    })
  }
})
```
