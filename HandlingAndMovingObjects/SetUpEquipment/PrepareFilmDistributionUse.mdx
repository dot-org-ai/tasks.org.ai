# Prepare Film Distribution Use

> Business-as-Code definition for preparing film for distribution or use. Models the workflow of processing, inspecting, packaging, and routing film reels and digital media assets for exhibition, archival, or commercial distribution.

## Overview

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { prepareFilmDistributionUse } from '@headlessly/prepare-film-distribution-use'

const film = prepareFilmDistributionUse()

// Inspect a film print before distribution
const inspection = await film.inspectPrint({
  reelId: 'REEL-2026-0412',
  title: 'Midnight Crossing',
  checkpoints: ['color-timing', 'sound-sync', 'physical-condition']
})

// Splice reels for theatrical projection
await film.spliceReels({
  reelIds: ['REEL-2026-0412-A', 'REEL-2026-0412-B', 'REEL-2026-0412-C'],
  projectionFormat: '35mm-scope'
})

// Route copies to exhibition venues
await film.routeToVenue({
  distributionOrderId: 'DO-2026-1187',
  venues: [
    { venueId: 'AMC-NYC-34', deliveryDate: '2026-03-15' },
    { venueId: 'REGAL-LA-07', deliveryDate: '2026-03-17' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert distribution coordinator when a print fails inspection
film.printInspected(async ({ reelId, passed, defects }) => {
  if (!passed) {
    await notify({
      to: 'distribution-coordinator',
      message: `Print ${reelId} failed inspection: ${defects.join(', ')}`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-archive film elements after distribution window closes
film.filmRoutedToVenue(async ({ distributionOrderId, returnDate }) => {
  await scheduleTask({
    action: 'archiveFilmElements',
    distributionOrderId,
    scheduledAt: returnDate
  })
})
```
