# Set Up Mechanical Equipment

> Business-as-Code definition for setting up mechanical equipment. Models the complete process of assembling, positioning, leveling, connecting, and commissioning mechanical machinery for production or operational use.

## Overview

Setting up mechanical equipment involves receiving, positioning, leveling, assembling, and commissioning machinery such as lathes, milling machines, presses, conveyors, pumps, and compressors. Technicians anchor equipment to foundations, connect power and utility services, install guards and safety devices, and perform initial calibration runs. A thorough setup ensures that equipment operates within manufacturer specifications, meets safety requirements, and produces quality output from the first production run.

## Actors

| Actor | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| EquipmentManufacturer | Supplies machinery and provides setup documentation |
| RiggingContractor | Transports and positions heavy equipment using cranes and forklifts |
| UtilitiesProvider | Connects electrical, compressed air, water, and drainage services |
| FacilitiesTeam | Prepares foundations, anchors, and floor space for equipment placement |
| InspectionAuthority | Certifies that installed equipment meets regulatory and safety standards |

## Roles

| installSafetyGuards | Mount guards, interlocks, and emergency stop devices |
| calibrateMachine | Adjust settings and run test cycles to verify accuracy |
| commissionEquipment | Perform formal startup and document performance results |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| equipmentPositioned | The machine has been moved to its designated location |
| anchoredToFoundation | The equipment has been bolted or grouted to the base |
| machineLeveled | The machine has been verified level within tolerance |
| utilitiesConnected | All power and service connections have been completed |
| safetyGuardsInstalled | Guards and interlocks have been mounted and tested |
| machineCalibrated | The equipment has been adjusted and test cycles confirm accuracy |
| equipmentCommissioned | Formal startup is complete and performance is documented |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| findSetupProjects | Retrieve equipment setup projects by status, machine type, or facility |
| getLevelingRecords | Get leveling measurements by machine or installation date |
| getCommissioningReports | List commissioning results by equipment, date, or pass/fail status |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { setUpMechanicalEquipment } from '@headlessly/set-up-mechanical-equipment'

const setup = setUpMechanicalEquipment()

// Position the machine on the prepared foundation
await setup.positionEquipment({
  equipmentId: 'CNC-lathe-haas-ST20Y',
  foundationId: 'pad-bay-12-station-C',
  riggingMethod: 'overhead-crane',
  weight: 8500,
  weightUnit: 'lbs'
})

// Anchor and level
await setup.anchorToFoundation({
  equipmentId: 'CNC-lathe-haas-ST20Y',
  anchorType: 'wedge-anchor',
  boltPattern: '4-corner',
  torque: 75,
  torqueUnit: 'ft-lb'
})

await setup.levelMachine({
  equipmentId: 'CNC-lathe-haas-ST20Y',
  method: 'precision-level',
  tolerance: 0.0005,
  unit: 'inches-per-foot'
})

// Connect utilities and commission
await setup.connectUtilities({
  equipmentId: 'CNC-lathe-haas-ST20Y',
  connections: [
    { type: 'electrical', spec: '480V-3PH-60A' },
    { type: 'compressed-air', spec: '90-PSI-10-CFM' },
    { type: 'coolant-drain', spec: '1-inch-NPT' }
  ]
})

await setup.commissionEquipment({
  equipmentId: 'CNC-lathe-haas-ST20Y',
  testProgram: 'spindle-warmup-and-axis-verification',
  performedBy: 'setup-tech-ramirez'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify inspection authority when guards are installed
setup.safetyGuardsInstalled(async ({ equipmentId }) => {
  await scheduleInspection({
    type: 'machine-safety-certification',
    equipmentId,
    authority: 'osha-compliance',
    priority: 'required-before-production'
  })
})

// Update asset management when equipment is commissioned
setup.equipmentCommissioned(async ({ equipmentId }) => {
  await updateAssetRegistry({
    equipmentId,
    status: 'operational',
    commissionedDate: new Date().toISOString(),
    nextPMDate: addDays(new Date(), 90)
  })
})
```
