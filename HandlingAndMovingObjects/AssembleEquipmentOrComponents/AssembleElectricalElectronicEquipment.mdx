# Assemble Electrical Electronic Equipment

> Business-as-Code definition for electrical and electronic equipment assembly. Models complete product build workflows from initial assembly through calibration and final testing.

## Overview

Electrical and electronic equipment assembly produces finished products such as power supplies, instrumentation, communication devices, and control systems through component integration, wiring, calibration, and testing. This definition supports manufacturing operations with process control, quality gates, and serialized product tracking.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { assembleElectricalElectronicEquipment } from '@headlessly/assemble-electrical-electronic-equipment'

const equipment = assembleElectricalElectronicEquipment()

// Assemble power supply unit
await equipment.assembleEquipment({
  orderId: 'PO-8821',
  productModel: 'PSU-48V-500W',
  assemblies: [
    { id: 'PCB-MAIN-REV-D', location: 'baseplate' },
    { id: 'PCB-CONTROL-REV-B', location: 'vertical-mount' },
    { id: 'HEATSINK-AL-150W', location: 'output-stage' }
  ]
})

await equipment.installHousing({
  orderId: 'PO-8821',
  enclosure: '19-inch-rack-2U',
  hardwareKit: 'HW-PSU-500W'
})

await equipment.connectWiring({
  orderId: 'PO-8821',
  connections: [
    { from: 'AC-INPUT-TERMINAL', to: 'PCB-MAIN-J1' },
    { from: 'PCB-MAIN-J2', to: 'DC-OUTPUT-TERMINAL' }
  ]
})

// Calibrate and test
await equipment.calibrateEquipment({
  orderId: 'PO-8821',
  procedure: 'CAL-PSU-48V',
  adjustments: [
    { parameter: 'output-voltage', target: 48.0, tolerance: 0.1 },
    { parameter: 'current-limit', target: 10.5, tolerance: 0.2 }
  ]
})

const test = await equipment.performFinalTest({
  orderId: 'PO-8821',
  procedure: 'TEST-PSU-FINAL',
  tests: ['output-voltage', 'ripple', 'efficiency', 'thermal']
})

await equipment.assignSerial({
  orderId: 'PO-8821',
  serialFormat: 'PSU48V{YYWW}{####}',
  labelLocation: 'rear-panel'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-generate calibration certificate
equipment.equipmentCalibrated(async ({ orderId, adjustments, timestamp }) => {
  await generateDocument({
    type: 'calibration-certificate',
    orderId,
    calibrationData: adjustments,
    date: timestamp,
    technician: getCurrentUser()
  })
})

// Track test failures by product model
equipment.finalTestPerformed(async ({ orderId, productModel, passed, failures }) => {
  if (!passed) {
    await recordMetric({
      type: 'test-failure',
      productModel,
      failures,
      timestamp: new Date()
    })
  }
})
```
