## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { installVehiclePartsAccessories } from '@headlessly/install-vehicle-parts-accessories'

const installation = installVehiclePartsAccessories()

// Consult with customer on parts installation
await installation.consultCustomer({
  customerId: 'CUST-2026-789',
  vehicle: { vin: '1HGBH41JXMN109186', year: 2023, make: 'Honda', model: 'Accord' },
  partsRequested: ['backup-camera', 'tow-hitch']
})

// Install backup camera
await installation.installNewPart({
  workOrderId: 'WO-2026-456',
  vehicle: '1HGBH41JXMN109186',
  part: { number: 'CAM-HD-550', type: 'backup-camera' },
  location: 'rear-bumper'
})

// Connect camera to vehicle systems
await installation.connectSystems({
  workOrderId: 'WO-2026-456',
  connections: ['reverse-light-trigger', 'display-video', 'power']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Test function after systems are connected
installation.systemsConnected(async ({ workOrderId, part }) => {
  await installation.testFunction({
    workOrderId,
    tests: ['power-on', 'image-quality', 'trigger-function']
  })
})

// Alert on test failure
installation.functionTested(async ({ workOrderId, result }) => {
  if (result.status === 'failed') {
    await notify({
      to: 'service-manager',
      message: `Work order ${workOrderId} failed test: ${result.failures.join(', ')}`
    })
  }
})
```
