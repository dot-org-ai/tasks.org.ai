# Embalm Corpses

> Business-as-Code definition for embalming human remains in mortuary science. Models the complete embalming workflow from preparation through preservation and presentation.

## Overview

Embalming corpses involves chemically preserving human remains through arterial injection, cavity treatment, and cosmetic restoration for viewing and burial. This definition exposes actions for case preparation, embalming procedures, restoration work, and documentation, with events for regulatory compliance and family coordination.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { embalmCorpses } from '@headlessly/embalm-corpses'

const embalming = embalmCorpses()

// Receive remains from hospital
const remains = await embalming.receiveRemains({
  deceasedName: 'Smith, John',
  dateOfDeath: '2026-02-03',
  timeOfDeath: '14:30',
  placeOfDeath: 'General Hospital',
  medicalExaminerCase: 'ME-2026-0234',
  receivedBy: 'embalmer-001',
  receivedDate: '2026-02-04'
})

// Obtain authorization from family
const authorization = await embalming.obtainAuthorization({
  caseId: remains.id,
  authorizedBy: 'Smith, Mary (Spouse)',
  relationship: 'spouse',
  procedures: ['arterial-embalming', 'cavity-treatment', 'cosmetology'],
  signedDate: '2026-02-04',
  witnessedBy: 'funeral-director-001'
})

// Prepare and perform embalming
await embalming.prepareSite({
  caseId: remains.id,
  roomAssignment: 'prep-room-1',
  tablePosition: 'supine',
  featuresSetting: {
    eyes: 'closed-eye-caps',
    mouth: 'closed-needle-injector',
    hands: 'positioned-naturally'
  }
})

await embalming.performArterialInjection({
  caseId: remains.id,
  injectionSite: 'right-common-carotid',
  drainageSite: 'right-jugular-vein',
  fluidType: 'high-index-arterial',
  fluidStrength: '25-index',
  volumeInjected: 3.5,
  volumeUnit: 'gallons',
  pressure: 12,
  pressureUnit: 'psi'
})

// Aspirate and treat cavities
await embalming.aspirateCavities({
  caseId: remains.id,
  aspirationSite: 'umbilical-region',
  volumeRemoved: 1200,
  volumeUnit: 'mL',
  contents: 'serous-fluid-gas'
})

await embalming.treatCavities({
  caseId: remains.id,
  cavityFluid: 'high-formaldehyde',
  volumeInjected: 32,
  volumeUnit: 'ounces'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert funeral director when embalming is complete
embalming.restorationPerformed(async ({ caseId, deceasedName }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'funeral-director',
    message: `Embalming complete for ${deceasedName}`,
    caseId,
    nextStep: 'Dressing and casketing'
  })

  await updateSchedule({
    caseId,
    status: 'ready-for-viewing',
    availableFrom: new Date().toISOString()
  })
})

// Track chemical inventory usage
embalming.arterialInjectionPerformed(async ({ fluidType, volumeInjected }) => {
  await updateInventory({
    product: fluidType,
    quantityUsed: volumeInjected,
    unit: 'gallons'
  })

  const currentStock = await checkInventory(fluidType)

  if (currentStock.quantity < currentStock.reorderPoint) {
    await notify({
      to: 'supply-coordinator',
      message: `Low inventory for ${fluidType}: ${currentStock.quantity} gallons remaining`,
      recommendation: 'Reorder supplies'
    })
  }
})
```
