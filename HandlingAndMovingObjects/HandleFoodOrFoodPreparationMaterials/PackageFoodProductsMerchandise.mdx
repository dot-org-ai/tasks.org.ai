## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { packageFoodProductsMerchandise } from '@headlessly/package-food-products-merchandise'

const packaging = packageFoodProductsMerchandise()

// Select packaging for artisan granola
const format = await packaging.selectPackagingFormat({
  product: 'Maple Pecan Granola',
  containerType: 'stand-up-pouch',
  material: 'kraft-with-window',
  size: '340g',
  sealType: 'heat-seal-with-zipper'
})

// Package individual units
const pkg = await packaging.portionIntoPackage({
  formatId: format.id,
  batchId: 'GRN-2026-0415-B2',
  targetWeight: 340,
  tolerance: { min: 338, max: 345, unit: 'grams' }
})

await packaging.sealPackage({ packageId: pkg.id, method: 'heat-seal', temperature: 165 })

await packaging.applyLabel({
  packageId: pkg.id,
  label: {
    productName: 'Maple Pecan Granola',
    netWeight: '340g',
    ingredients: 'Oats, Maple Syrup, Pecans, Coconut Oil, Sea Salt',
    allergens: ['Tree Nuts'],
    bestBefore: '2026-10-15',
    barcode: '0-12345-67890-4'
  }
})

// Inspect and case-pack
await packaging.inspectPackage({ packageId: pkg.id })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Halt line on seal failure
packaging.sealFailureDetected(async ({ packageId, lineId, failureType }) => {
  await pauseLine({ lineId })
  await notify({
    to: 'maintenance-team',
    message: `Seal failure (${failureType}) on line ${lineId}. Package ${packageId} rejected.`
  })
})

// Notify warehouse when pallet is ready
packaging.palletReady(async ({ palletId, caseCount, product, destination }) => {
  await schedulePickup({
    palletId,
    cases: caseCount,
    product,
    destination,
    priority: 'standard'
  })
})
```
