for (const item of items) {
  await display.positionItems({
    arrangementId: arrangement.id,

    action: 'rotation-complete',
    count: itemsReplaced.length
  })
})

// Flag temperature compliance issues
display.temperatureSet(async ({ displayCase, temperature, requiredRange }) => {
  if (temperature > requiredRange.max) {
    await notify({
      to: 'food-safety-manager',
      message: `Display case ${displayCase} at ${temperature}F exceeds max of ${requiredRange.max}F`
