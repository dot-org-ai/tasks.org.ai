## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { repairTextilesApparel } from '@headlessly/repair-textiles-apparel'

const repairs = repairTextilesApparel()

// Assess damage on a submitted garment
const assessment = await repairs.assessDamage({
  garmentId: 'GRM-2024-0891',
  damageType: 'tear',
  location: 'left-sleeve-seam',
  fabricType: 'wool-blend',
  severity: 'moderate'
})

// Generate cost estimate
const estimate = await repairs.estimateCost({
  repairOrderId: assessment.repairOrderId,
  technique: 'invisible-reweaving',
  materials: [{ type: 'matching-wool-thread', quantity: 2 }]
})

// Execute the repair
await repairs.executeRepair({
  repairOrderId: assessment.repairOrderId,
  technique: 'invisible-reweaving',
  notes: 'Match original weave pattern at seam junction'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify customer when repair is complete
repairs.repairInspected(async ({ repairOrderId, passed }) => {
  if (passed) {
    await notify({
      to: 'customer',
      message: `Your item (order ${repairOrderId}) is ready for pickup.`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-reorder materials when sourcing is triggered
repairs.materialsSourced(async ({ repairOrderId, materials }) => {
  for (const material of materials) {
    if (material.inventoryLevel < material.reorderThreshold) {
      await reorderMaterial({ sku: material.sku, quantity: material.reorderQuantity })
    }
  }
})
```
