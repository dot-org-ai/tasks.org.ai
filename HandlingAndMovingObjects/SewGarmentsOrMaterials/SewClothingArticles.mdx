## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { sewClothingArticles } from '@headlessly/sew-clothing-articles'

const sewing = sewClothingArticles()

// Cut fabric for a production order
const cutPieces = await sewing.cutFabric({
  orderId: 'GO-2026-1150',
  patternId: 'PAT-BLAZER-42R',
  fabricBolt: 'FB-WOOL-CHARCOAL-220',
  quantity: 50
})

// Assemble garment pieces
const garment = await sewing.assemblePieces({
  orderId: 'GO-2026-1150',
  pieces: cutPieces.fabricPieces,
  constructionSequence: ['back-panel', 'front-panels', 'sleeves', 'collar', 'lining']
})

// Attach closures and finish
await sewing.attachClosure({
  garmentId: garment.id,
  closureType: 'button',
  positions: ['center-front-1', 'center-front-2', 'center-front-3'],
  buttonStyle: 'horn-4-hole-20mm'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Move garment to finishing station when assembly completes
sewing.piecesAssembled(async ({ garmentId, orderId }) => {
  await assignToStation({
    garmentId,
    station: 'finishing',
    priority: await getOrderPriority(orderId)
  })
})

// Alert production lead when inspection fails
sewing.garmentInspected(async ({ garmentId, passed, defects }) => {
  if (!passed) {
    await notify({
      to: 'production-lead',
      message: `Garment ${garmentId} failed inspection: ${defects.map(d => d.type).join(', ')}`
    })
  }
})
```
