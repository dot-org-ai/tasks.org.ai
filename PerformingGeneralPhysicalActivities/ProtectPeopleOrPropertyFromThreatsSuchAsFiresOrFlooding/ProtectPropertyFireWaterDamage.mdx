# Protect Property Fire Water Damage

> Business-as-Code definition for protecting property from fire or water damage. Models the risk assessment, preventive measures, active response, and damage documentation workflow.

## Overview

Protecting property from fire or water damage involves assessing structural and environmental risks, implementing preventive measures such as fireproofing and flood barriers, executing active protection during emergencies, and documenting damage for insurance and restoration purposes. This definition exposes actions for hazard assessment, barrier deployment, salvage operations, and post-incident reporting.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { protectPropertyFireWaterDamage } from '@headlessly/protect-property-fire-water-damage'

const protection = protectPropertyFireWaterDamage()

// Assess flood risk for a property
const assessment = await protection.assessHazard({
  propertyId: 'PROP-2024-0155',
  threatType: 'flooding',
  waterLevel: 4.2, // feet above normal
  proximityToWaterway: 0.3 // miles
})

// Deploy flood barriers
await protection.deployBarriers({
  propertyId: 'PROP-2024-0155',
  barrierType: 'sandbags-and-pumps',
  perimeterCoverage: ['north-entrance', 'basement-windows', 'loading-dock']
})

// Execute salvage operations for high-value items
await protection.executeSalvageOperations({
  propertyId: 'PROP-2024-0155',
  items: [
    { description: 'Server room equipment', location: 'Basement Level 1' },
    { description: 'Paper records archive', location: 'Ground Floor Storage' }
  ]
})

// Pump water after flooding subsides
await protection.pumpWater({ propertyId: 'PROP-2024-0155', areas: ['basement', 'parking-garage'] })
await protection.documentDamage({ propertyId: 'PROP-2024-0155' })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-deploy barriers when flood warning is received
protection.hazardAssessed(async ({ propertyId, threatType, riskLevel }) => {
  if (threatType === 'flooding' && riskLevel === 'high') {
    await protection.deployBarriers({
      propertyId,
      barrierType: 'sandbags-and-pumps',
      perimeterCoverage: ['all-ground-level-entries']
    })
  }
})

// File insurance claim automatically after damage documentation
protection.damageDocumented(async ({ propertyId, damageEstimate, photos }) => {
  if (damageEstimate > 5000) {
    await protection.submitInsuranceClaim({
      propertyId,
      estimatedLoss: damageEstimate,
      supportingDocuments: photos
    })
  }
})
```
