# Perform Manual Agricultural Aquacultural Horticultural

> Business-as-Code definition for carrying out hands-on agricultural, aquacultural, and horticultural labor including harvesting, weeding, pruning, feeding fish, and tending greenhouse plants. Models the task assignment and execution lifecycle for manual production work.

## Overview

Performing manual agricultural, aquacultural, or horticultural tasks covers the physical labor activities that sustain crop production, fish farming, and plant cultivation. This includes hand-harvesting produce, weeding fields, pruning vines and trees, feeding and monitoring aquaculture stock, potting and transplanting nursery plants, and maintaining greenhouse environments. The definition standardizes how manual tasks are assigned, tracked, and verified across diverse growing operations.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { performManualAgriculturalAquaculturalHorticultural } from '@headlessly/perform-manual-agricultural-aquacultural-horticultural'

const manual = performManualAgriculturalAquaculturalHorticultural()

// Assign daily tasks to the field crew
const assignments = await manual.assignTasks({
  date: '2026-06-15',
  crew: ['L-001', 'L-002', 'L-003', 'L-004'],
  tasks: [
    { type: 'harvest', field: 'strawberry-block-A', rows: '1-12' },
    { type: 'weed', field: 'tomato-rows-north', rows: '1-8' },
    { type: 'feed', pond: 'tilapia-pond-3', feedType: 'floating-pellet', amount: { kg: 25 } }
  ]
})

// Log completed harvest
await manual.harvestCrop({
  fieldId: 'strawberry-block-A',
  crop: 'strawberries',
  quantity: { amount: 340, unit: 'lbs' },
  grade: 'premium',
  laborerIds: ['L-001', 'L-002']
})

// Record the production day
await manual.logProduction({
  date: '2026-06-15',
  completedTasks: assignments.tasks.length,
  totalLaborHours: 32
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify packing house when harvest batch is ready
manual.cropHarvested(async ({ fieldId, crop, quantity, grade }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'packing-house',
    message: `${quantity.amount} ${quantity.unit} of ${grade} ${crop} ready for pickup from ${fieldId}`
  })
})

// Alert supervisor when feed schedule is missed
manual.stockFed(async ({ pondId, scheduledTime, actualTime }) => {
  const delayMinutes = (new Date(actualTime).getTime() - new Date(scheduledTime).getTime()) / 60000
  if (delayMinutes > 30) {
    await notify({
      to: 'crew-supervisor',
      message: `Feeding at ${pondId} delayed by ${Math.round(delayMinutes)} minutes`
    })
  }
})
```
