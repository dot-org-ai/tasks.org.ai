# Cultivate Lawns Turf Gardens

> Business-as-Code definition for cultivating and maintaining lawns, turf areas, and gardens through mowing, fertilizing, aerating, weeding, and soil management. Models the ongoing care cycle from condition assessment through treatment application and health monitoring.

## Overview

Cultivating lawns, turf, or gardens involves the ongoing physical care activities that maintain healthy, attractive ground cover and garden beds. This definition covers soil testing, mowing and trimming, aeration, overseeding, fertilization, weed control, and seasonal cleanup across residential lawns, commercial turf, sports fields, and ornamental gardens. It standardizes the assessment-treatment-monitoring loop that drives effective grounds maintenance.

## Actors

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { cultivateLawnsTurfGardens } from '@headlessly/cultivate-lawns-turf-gardens'

const cultivation = cultivateLawnsTurfGardens()

// Assess current turf condition
const condition = await cultivation.assessCondition({
  propertyId: 'PROP-2026-0122',
  areas: ['front-lawn', 'backyard', 'side-strip'],
  metrics: ['density', 'color-score', 'weed-percentage', 'compaction']
})

// Submit soil test based on assessment
const soilTest = await cultivation.testSoil({
  propertyId: 'PROP-2026-0122',
  sampleLocations: condition.areas.map(a => a.id),
  tests: ['pH', 'nitrogen', 'phosphorus', 'potassium', 'organic-matter']
})

// Apply recommended fertilizer
await cultivation.applyFertilizer({
  propertyId: 'PROP-2026-0122',
  product: '24-0-6-slow-release',
  rate: { amount: 4, unit: 'lbs-per-1000sqft' },
  areas: ['front-lawn', 'backyard']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Schedule aeration when compaction is detected
cultivation.conditionAssessed(async ({ propertyId, areas }) => {
  const compacted = areas.filter(a => a.compaction > 300)
  if (compacted.length > 0) {
    await workOrder.create({
      type: 'aeration',
      propertyId,
      areas: compacted.map(a => a.id),
      priority: 'seasonal'
    })
  }
})

// Auto-generate treatment record after fertilizer application
cultivation.fertilizerApplied(async ({ propertyId, product, rate, appliedBy }) => {
  await treatmentRecord.create({
    propertyId,
    product,
    rate,
    appliedBy,
    date: new Date().toISOString(),
    type: 'fertilizer'
  })
})
```
