## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { plantGreeneryImproveLandscapeAppearance } from '@headlessly/plant-greenery-improve-landscape-appearance'

const landscaping = plantGreeneryImproveLandscapeAppearance()

// Assess the property site conditions
const site = await landscaping.assessSite({
  propertyId: 'PROP-2026-0155',
  areas: ['front-entry', 'side-border', 'rear-patio'],
  factors: ['soil-type', 'sun-exposure', 'drainage', 'hardiness-zone']
})

// Source plants from the approved planting plan
const order = await landscaping.sourcePlants({
  plantingPlanId: 'PP-2026-0042',
  items: [
    { species: 'Acer rubrum', size: '2-inch-caliper', quantity: 3 },
    { species: 'Hydrangea paniculata', size: '5-gallon', quantity: 12 },
    { species: 'Liriope muscari', size: 'flat-of-18', quantity: 8 }
  ]
})

// Install and establish
await landscaping.installPlants({
  plantingPlanId: 'PP-2026-0042',
  deliveryId: order.deliveryId
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify property owner when installation is complete
landscaping.plantsInstalled(async ({ propertyId, plantingPlanId, plantCount }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'property-owner',
    message: `${plantCount} plants installed at ${propertyId} per plan ${plantingPlanId}`
  })
})

// Schedule follow-up watering checks during establishment
landscaping.establishmentStarted(async ({ propertyId, schedule }) => {
  for (const checkDate of schedule.wateringDates) {
    await scheduler.schedule({
      action: 'checkWatering',
      propertyId,
      executeAt: checkDate
    })
  }
})
```
