| PickupSchedule | A recurring calendar for trash collection services |
| WasteTicket | A record of collection volume, date, and destination |
| ContaminationReport | Documentation of recycling bin contamination issues |
| ServiceContract | An agreement with a waste hauler for collection services |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { removeTrash } from '@headlessly/remove-trash'

const trash = removeTrash()

// Service office floor bins
await trash.serviceBins({
  buildingId: 'OFFICE-TOWER-1',
  floor: 3,
  custodianId: 'CUST-011',
  binCount: 24
})

// Stage and log collection
await trash.stageBags({
  buildingId: 'OFFICE-TOWER-1',
  stagingArea: 'loading-dock',
  bagCount: 12
})

await trash.logPickup({
  routeId: 'ROUTE-DOWNTOWN-A',
  stop: 'OFFICE-TOWER-1',
  volume: { cubicYards: 4 },
  destination: 'county-landfill'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-adjust schedule when volumes spike
trash.pickupLogged(async ({ routeId, volume }) => {
  const history = await trash.getVolumeHistory({ routeId, days: 30 })
  const average = history.reduce((sum, h) => sum + h.volume, 0) / history.length
  if (volume > average * 1.5) {
    await trash.adjustSchedule({ routeId, frequency: 'increase' })
  }
})

// Alert recycling coordinator on contamination
trash.contaminationReported(async ({ binId, contaminant }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'recycling-coordinator',
    message: `Bin ${binId} contaminated with ${contaminant} - re-education needed`
  })
})
```
