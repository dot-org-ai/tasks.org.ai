## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { moveFurniture } from '@headlessly/move-furniture'

const furniture = moveFurniture()

// Survey inventory for an office move
const inventory = await furniture.surveyInventory({
  moveOrderId: 'MO-2026-0331',
  location: '400 Market St, Suite 800',
  items: [
    { name: 'Executive Desk', dimensions: '72x36x30in', weight: 95, condition: 'good' },
    { name: 'Conference Table', dimensions: '120x48x30in', weight: 220, condition: 'good' },
    { name: 'Filing Cabinet 4-Drawer', dimensions: '15x25x52in', weight: 65, condition: 'fair' }
  ]
})

// Pack and load
await furniture.packFurniture({
  moveOrderId: 'MO-2026-0331',
  items: inventory.items.map(i => i.id),
  materials: ['moving-blankets', 'shrink-wrap', 'corner-protectors']
})

await furniture.loadFurniture({
  moveOrderId: 'MO-2026-0331',
  vehicleId: 'TRUCK-26FT-04',
  loadedBy: 'crew-alpha'
})

// Place furniture at new office

// Notify client when furniture arrives at destination
furniture.furnitureTransported(async ({ moveOrderId, destination }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'client',
    message: `Your furniture has arrived at ${destination}. Unloading will begin shortly.`
  })
})

// Auto-generate damage report if issues found during placement
furniture.furniturePlaced(async ({ moveOrderId, items }) => {
  const damaged = items.filter(i => i.conditionChange)
  if (damaged.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'move-coordinator',
      message: `${damaged.length} item(s) with condition changes on move ${moveOrderId}`
    })
  }
})
```
