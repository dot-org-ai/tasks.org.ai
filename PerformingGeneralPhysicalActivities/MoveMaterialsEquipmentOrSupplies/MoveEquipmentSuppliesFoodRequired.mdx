## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { moveEquipmentSuppliesFoodRequired } from '@headlessly/move-equipment-supplies-food-required'

const distribution = moveEquipmentSuppliesFoodRequired()

// Schedule a morning meal tray delivery run
const run = await distribution.scheduleRun({
  route: 'Floor-3-East-Wing',
  stops: ['Room-301', 'Room-302', 'Room-305', 'Room-308', 'Room-312'],
  runType: 'meal-delivery',
  scheduledTime: '2026-02-05T07:30:00Z',
  assignedTo: 'aide-mwilson'
})

// Prepare the distribution cart
await distribution.prepareCart({
  runId: run.id,
  items: [
    { type: 'meal-tray', patient: 'Room-301', dietaryCode: 'cardiac-low-sodium' },
    { type: 'meal-tray', patient: 'Room-302', dietaryCode: 'diabetic' },
    { type: 'meal-tray', patient: 'Room-305', dietaryCode: 'regular' },
    { type: 'meal-tray', patient: 'Room-308', dietaryCode: 'pureed' },
    { type: 'meal-tray', patient: 'Room-312', dietaryCode: 'regular' }
  ],
  temperatureCheck: { hot: 63, cold: 5, unit: 'C' }
})

// Deliver and confirm at each stop
await distribution.deliverItems({
  runId: run.id,
  stop: 'Room-301',
  deliveredBy: 'aide-mwilson',
  confirmedBy: 'nurse-lpatel'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert kitchen when par levels drop below threshold
distribution.locationRestocked(async ({ location, item, currentLevel, parLevel }) => {
  if (currentLevel < parLevel * 0.3) {
    await notify({
      to: 'kitchen-manager',
      message: `Low stock alert: ${item} at ${location} is at ${currentLevel}/${parLevel}`
    })
  }
})

// Track meal tray delivery compliance
distribution.receiptConfirmed(async ({ runId, stop, deliveredAt, scheduledTime }) => {
  const delayMinutes = (new Date(deliveredAt).getTime() - new Date(scheduledTime).getTime()) / 60000
  if (delayMinutes > 15) {
    await logComplianceIssue({
      runId,
      location: stop,
      issue: `Meal delivery ${Math.round(delayMinutes)} minutes late`
    })
  }
})
```
