## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { transportAnimalsCropsEquipment } from '@headlessly/transport-animals-crops-equipment'

const transport = transportAnimalsCropsEquipment()

// Schedule a livestock transport
const shipment = await transport.scheduleTransport({
  cargoType: 'livestock',
  description: '45 head of cattle',
  origin: 'Bar-K Ranch, Field Station 3',
  destination: 'Midwest Livestock Auction',
  vehicleId: 'TRAILER-LV-08',
  scheduledDate: '2026-02-10T06:00:00Z'
})

// Load and secure the cargo
await transport.loadCargo({
  shipmentId: shipment.id,
  itemCount: 45,
  loadedBy: 'handler-jmartinez'
})

await transport.secureCargo({
  shipmentId: shipment.id,
  method: 'livestock-partition',
  verifiedBy: 'handler-jmartinez'
})

// Record delivery at destination
await transport.deliverCargo({
  shipmentId: shipment.id,
  receivedBy: 'Midwest Livestock Auction - Dock B',
  conditionNotes: 'All animals in good health, no injuries observed'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert destination when transport departs
transport.transitDeparted(async ({ shipmentId, destination, estimatedArrival }) => {
  await notify({
    to: destination,
    message: `Shipment ${shipmentId} en route, ETA ${estimatedArrival}`
  })
})

// Flag compliance issues during transit monitoring
transport.transitMonitored(async ({ shipmentId, temperature, humidity }) => {
  if (temperature > 35) {
    await notify({
      to: 'transport-dispatch',
      message: `High temperature alert for shipment ${shipmentId}: ${temperature}C`
    })
  }
})
```
