## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { deliverItems } from '@headlessly/deliver-items'

const delivery = deliverItems()

// Create a delivery order for office supplies
const order = await delivery.createDeliveryOrder({
  sender: { name: 'Central Warehouse', address: '500 Distribution Way' },
  recipient: { name: 'Branch Office North', address: '120 Commerce Dr, Suite 300' },
  items: [
    { description: 'Printer paper - 10 reams', weight: 22, sku: 'SUP-PP-010' },
    { description: 'Toner cartridges - 4 pack', weight: 3, sku: 'SUP-TC-004' }
  ],
  priority: 'standard',
  requestedDelivery: '2026-02-06T14:00:00'
})

// Assign route and pick up
await delivery.assignRoute({
  orderId: order.id,
  driverId: 'DRV-042',
  route: ['warehouse-dock-3', 'branch-office-north'],
  estimatedDuration: 45
})

await delivery.pickupItem({
  orderId: order.id,
  location: 'warehouse-dock-3',
  pickupTime: new Date()
})

// Deliver and confirm
await delivery.deliverToRecipient({
  orderId: order.id,
  recipient: 'J. Martinez',
  proofOfDelivery: { type: 'signature', data: 'base64-signature-data' }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify recipient when item is in transit
delivery.itemInTransit(async ({ orderId, recipientId, eta }) => {
  await notify({
    to: recipientId,
    message: `Your delivery ${orderId} is on the way. Estimated arrival: ${eta}`
  })
})

// Auto-reschedule failed deliveries
delivery.deliveryFailed(async ({ orderId, reason, attemptCount }) => {
  if (attemptCount < 3) {
    await delivery.assignRoute({
      orderId,
      reschedule: true,
      nextAttempt: getNextBusinessDay()
    })
  } else {
    await delivery.handleException({
      orderId,
      action: 'return-to-sender',
      reason
    })
  }
})
```
