```typescript
import { performHousekeepingDuties } from '@headlessly/perform-housekeeping-duties'

const housekeeping = performHousekeepingDuties()

// Assign morning room block
const assignments = await housekeeping.assignRooms({
  attendantId: 'RA-023',
  rooms: ['301', '302', '305', '307', '310'],
  priority: 'checkout-first'
})

// Clean and restock a room
await housekeeping.cleanRoom({ roomId: '301', type: 'checkout-deep-clean' })
await housekeeping.restockAmenities({
  roomId: '301',
  items: ['bath-towels', 'shampoo', 'coffee-pods']
})

    await notify({
      to: 'front-desk',
      message: `Room ${roomId} is ready for guest check-in`
    })

  const levels = await housekeeping.getLinenLevels({ type })
  if (levels.available < levels.parLevel) {
    await notify({
      to: 'linen-supplier',
      message: `Reorder needed: ${type} - current: ${levels.available}, par: ${levels.parLevel}`
