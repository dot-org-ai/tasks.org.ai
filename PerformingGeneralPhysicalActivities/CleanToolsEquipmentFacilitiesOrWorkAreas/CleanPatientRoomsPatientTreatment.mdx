## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { cleanPatientRoomsPatientTreatment } from '@headlessly/clean-patient-rooms-patient-treatment'

const rooms = cleanPatientRoomsPatientTreatment()

// Initiate a room turnover after patient discharge
const order = await rooms.initiateCleaningOrder({
  roomId: 'ICU-204',
  dischargeTime: '2026-02-05T14:30:00Z',
  precautions: ['contact', 'droplet'],
  priority: 'stat'
})

// Assign a technician and execute protocol
await rooms.assignTechnician({
  orderId: order.id,
  technicianId: 'EVS-047'
})

// Certify room after inspection
await rooms.certifyReadiness({
  orderId: order.id,
  inspectorId: 'SUP-012',
  notes: 'All high-touch surfaces verified with ATP testing'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert nursing station when room is ready
rooms.roomCertified(async ({ roomId, certifiedAt }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'nursing-station',
    message: `Room ${roomId} is clean and ready for admission as of ${certifiedAt}`
  })
})

// Escalate protocol violations to infection prevention
rooms.protocolViolationDetected(async ({ roomId, violation }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'infection-prevention',
    message: `Protocol violation in ${roomId}: ${violation.description}`
  })
})
```
