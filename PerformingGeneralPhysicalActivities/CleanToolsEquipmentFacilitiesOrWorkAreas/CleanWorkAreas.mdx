# Clean Work Areas

> Business-as-Code definition for cleaning work areas. Models the routine and on-demand cleaning of workstations, shop floors, laboratories, and shared operational spaces to maintain safety and productivity.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { cleanWorkAreas } from '@headlessly/clean-work-areas'

const workAreas = cleanWorkAreas()

// Clear end-of-shift debris from the machine shop floor
await workAreas.clearDebris({
  areaId: 'machine-shop-b',
  debrisType: 'metal-shavings',
  method: 'industrial-vacuum'
})

// Disinfect shared lab benches
await workAreas.disinfectSurfaces({
  areaId: 'chemistry-lab-2',
  agent: 'isopropyl-alcohol-70',
  surfaces: ['bench-tops', 'fume-hood-sashes', 'door-handles']
})

// Log the completed cleaning
await workAreas.logCleaning({
  areaId: 'machine-shop-b',
  shift: 'second',
  completedBy: 'operator-45',
  tasks: ['debris-cleared', 'floors-swept', 'waste-disposed']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Trigger hazmat response for chemical spills
workAreas.spillContained(async ({ areaId, substance, severity }) => {
  if (severity === 'high') {
    await notify({
      to: 'safety-coordinator',
      message: `Hazardous spill of ${substance} in ${areaId} requires follow-up inspection`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-generate cleaning checklists at shift start
workAreas.areaReadyForUse(async ({ areaId, shift }) => {
  await workAreas.logCleaning({
    areaId,
    shift,
    status: 'verified-clean'
  })
})
```
