## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { cleanFacilitiesSites } from '@headlessly/clean-facilities-sites'

const site = cleanFacilitiesSites()

// Set up a cleaning contract
const contract = await site.createContract({
  siteId: 'CAMPUS-NORTH',
  provider: 'ProClean Services',
  zones: ['building-a', 'building-b', 'parking', 'grounds'],
  frequency: 'weekly',
  startDate: '2026-01-01'
})

// Execute a full cleaning sweep
await site.executeCleaningSweep({
  contractId: contract.id,
  zones: ['building-a', 'parking'],
  crewId: 'CREW-12'
})

// Inspect the site
await site.inspectSite({
  siteId: 'CAMPUS-NORTH',
  inspectorId: 'CO-005'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify site owner of completed inspections
site.siteInspected(async ({ siteId, score, deficiencies }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'site-owner',
    message: `Site ${siteId} inspection score: ${score}. Issues: ${deficiencies.length}`
  })
})

// Auto-schedule remediation for failed inspections
site.siteInspected(async ({ siteId, score }) => {
  if (score < 80) {
    await site.executeCleaningSweep({
      siteId,
      priority: 'urgent',
      scope: 'remediation'
    })
  }
})
```
