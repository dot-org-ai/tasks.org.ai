## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { cleanFacilitiesEquipment } from '@headlessly/clean-facilities-equipment'

const facilities = cleanFacilitiesEquipment()

// Assign a nightly cleaning task for the office building lobby
const task = await facilities.assignTask({
  facility: 'building-a',
  area: 'main-lobby',
  assignee: 'custodian-12',
  type: 'routine-nightly',
  checklist: ['vacuum-carpets', 'mop-tile', 'disinfect-surfaces', 'empty-trash']
})

// Clean a production line conveyor system
await facilities.cleanEquipment({
  assetId: 'conveyor-belt-07',
  method: 'pressure-wash',
  detergent: 'industrial-degreaser',
  downtime: 45
})

// Inspect and close out the task
const inspection = await facilities.inspectCleanliness({
  taskId: task.id,
  standard: 'ISSA-clean-standard'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify maintenance when issues are found during cleaning
facilities.issueReported(async ({ facilityId, area, description }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'maintenance-team',
    message: `Issue in ${facilityId} / ${area}: ${description}`
  })
})

// Auto-reorder supplies when stock drops below threshold
facilities.suppliesRestocked(async ({ item, currentLevel, reorderPoint }) => {
  if (currentLevel <= reorderPoint) {
    await facilities.restockSupplies({
      item,
      quantity: reorderPoint * 2,
      vendor: 'preferred-supplier'
    })
  }
})
```
