|-------|-------------|
| PropertyManager | Defines cleaning standards and approves service contracts |
| CleaningContractor | Provides specialized wall and floor cleaning services |
| ChemicalVendor | Supplies surface-specific cleaning agents and sealants |
| BuildingInspector | Evaluates facility conditions during regulatory reviews |
| TenantOccupant | Reports surface cleaning needs and provides access |

## Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| FloorCareTechnician | Operates floor cleaning and restoration equipment |
| JanitorialLead | Assigns and supervises wall and floor cleaning tasks |
| FacilitiesCoordinator | Schedules cleaning around building occupancy |
| QualityReviewer | Inspects cleaned surfaces for compliance with standards |

## Entities

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| SurfaceProfile | A record of surface type, finish, and cleaning requirements |
| CleaningTask | A scheduled or ad-hoc wall or floor cleaning assignment |
| CleaningMethod | A procedure specifying chemicals, equipment, and technique |
| FloorEquipment | Machines such as scrubbers, buffers, and extractors |
| InspectionResult | Documentation of post-cleaning surface condition |
| ChemicalApplication | A record of cleaning agents applied with dilution ratios |

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| assessSurface | Evaluate surface type and condition before cleaning |
| selectMethod | Choose the appropriate cleaning method for the surface |
| executeClean | Perform the wall or floor cleaning procedure |
| applyFinish | Apply sealant, wax, or protective coating after cleaning |
| inspectSurface | Verify cleaned surface meets quality standards |
| logCompletion | Record the completed cleaning task with details |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| surfaceAssessed | Surface condition has been evaluated |
| methodSelected | Cleaning method has been chosen for the surface |
| cleaningExecuted | Wall or floor cleaning procedure has been completed |
| finishApplied | Protective finish or sealant has been applied |
| surfaceInspected | Post-cleaning quality check has been performed |
| completionLogged | Cleaning task has been documented as complete |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| findTasksByZone | List cleaning tasks by building zone or floor |
| getSurfaceProfiles | Retrieve surface specifications for a facility |
| getCleaningHistory | Pull past cleaning records for a surface or area |
| findOverdueTasks | Locate wall or floor cleaning tasks past their schedule |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { cleanBuildingWallsFlooring } from '@headlessly/clean-building-walls-flooring'

const surfaces = cleanBuildingWallsFlooring()

// Assess and clean a lobby floor
const assessment = await surfaces.assessSurface({
  location: 'main-lobby',
  surfaceType: 'polished-marble',
  condition: 'light-soiling'
})

const method = await surfaces.selectMethod({
  surfaceProfileId: assessment.profileId,
  soilLevel: 'light'
})

await surfaces.executeClean({
  taskId: 'TASK-4021',
  methodId: method.id,
  technicianId: 'FCT-008'
})

// Apply protective finish
await surfaces.applyFinish({
  taskId: 'TASK-4021',
  finishType: 'marble-sealant',
  coats: 2
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Schedule follow-up inspection after finish cures
surfaces.finishApplied(async ({ taskId, cureTimeHours }) => {
  await scheduleTask({
    action: 'inspectSurface',
    taskId,
    delay: `${cureTimeHours}h`
  })
})

// Alert facilities when overdue tasks accumulate
surfaces.cleaningExecuted(async ({ zone }) => {
  const overdue = await surfaces.findOverdueTasks({ zone })
  if (overdue.length > 5) {
    await notify({
      to: 'facilities-coordinator',
      message: `${overdue.length} overdue surface cleaning tasks in ${zone}`
    })
  }
})
```
