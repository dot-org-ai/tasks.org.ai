## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { cleanToolsEquipment } from '@headlessly/clean-tools-equipment'

const tools = cleanToolsEquipment()

// Receive and clean a returned tool
const receipt = await tools.receiveTool({
  toolId: 'DRILL-042',
  returnedBy: 'TP-019',
  condition: 'soiled-with-concrete'
})

await tools.cleanTool({
  toolId: 'DRILL-042',
  method: 'solvent-wipe',
  agent: 'mineral-spirits'
})

// Assess and store
const assessment = await tools.assessCondition({ toolId: 'DRILL-042' })

if (assessment.status === 'good') {
  await tools.applyLubricant({ toolId: 'DRILL-042', type: 'light-machine-oil' })
  await tools.returnToStorage({ toolId: 'DRILL-042', location: 'RACK-B3' })
}
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-notify inventory when tools are damaged
tools.damageReported(async ({ toolId, damage }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'inventory-manager',
    message: `Tool ${toolId} damaged: ${damage.description}. Replacement needed: ${damage.severity === 'critical'}`
  })
})

// Track cleaning frequency for maintenance scheduling
tools.toolCleaned(async ({ toolId, cleanedAt }) => {
  const history = await tools.getCleaningHistory({ toolId, limit: 10 })
  if (history.length >= 50) {
    await notify({
      to: 'maintenance-tech',
      message: `Tool ${toolId} has reached 50 cleaning cycles - schedule reconditioning`
    })
  }
})
```
