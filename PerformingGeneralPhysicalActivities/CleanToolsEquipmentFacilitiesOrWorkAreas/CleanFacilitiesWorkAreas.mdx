## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { cleanFacilitiesWorkAreas } from '@headlessly/clean-facilities-work-areas'

const facilities = cleanFacilitiesWorkAreas()

// Create a weekly cleaning schedule
const schedule = await facilities.createSchedule({
  facilityId: 'BLDG-100',
  zones: ['lobby', 'restrooms', 'breakroom', 'offices'],
  frequency: 'daily',
  deepCleanFrequency: 'weekly'
})

// Generate today's work orders
const orders = await facilities.generateWorkOrders({
  scheduleId: schedule.id,
  date: '2026-02-05'
})

// Complete and inspect
await facilities.completeChecklist({ workOrderId: orders[0].id })
await facilities.conductInspection({ workOrderId: orders[0].id, inspectorId: 'QI-003' })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-reorder when supplies run low
facilities.checklistCompleted(async ({ zoneId, suppliesUsed }) => {
  const levels = await facilities.getSupplyLevels({ zoneId })
  for (const item of levels.filter(s => s.quantity < s.reorderPoint)) {
    await facilities.reorderSupplies({ itemId: item.id, quantity: item.reorderQuantity })
  }
})

// Escalate failed inspections
facilities.inspectionFailed(async ({ workOrderId, deficiencies }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'janitorial-supervisor',
    message: `Rework needed on ${workOrderId}: ${deficiencies.join(', ')}`
  })
})
```
