## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainCleanWorkAreas } from '@headlessly/maintain-clean-work-areas'

const areas = maintainCleanWorkAreas()

// Define cleaning rotation for a production floor
const rotation = await areas.defineRotation({
  areaId: 'PROD-FLOOR-A',
  shifts: ['morning', 'afternoon', 'night'],
  tasks: ['sweep-floors', 'wipe-surfaces', 'empty-bins'],
  intervalMinutes: 120
})

// Log a completed cleaning activity
await areas.logCleaningActivity({
  areaId: 'PROD-FLOOR-A',
  task: 'sweep-floors',
  attendantId: 'ATT-012',
  completedAt: '2026-02-05T10:15:00Z'
})

// Request spot clean for a spill
await areas.requestSpotClean({
  areaId: 'PROD-FLOOR-A',
  description: 'Oil spill near station 4',
  priority: 'urgent'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-assign spot clean requests to nearest attendant
areas.spotCleanRequested(async ({ areaId, priority }) => {
  const available = await areas.getRotationSchedule({ areaId })
  await notify({
    to: available.currentAttendant,
    message: `Spot clean needed in ${areaId} - priority: ${priority}`
  })
})

// Escalate repeated audit failures
areas.auditFailed(async ({ areaId, failureCount }) => {
  if (failureCount >= 3) {
    await notify({
      to: 'safety-officer',
      message: `Recurring cleanliness failures in ${areaId} - immediate review required`
    })
  }
})
```
