## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { cleanFoodServiceAreas } from '@headlessly/clean-food-service-areas'

const foodService = cleanFoodServiceAreas()

// Create sanitation schedule for a restaurant
const schedule = await foodService.createSanitationSchedule({
  facilityId: 'RESTAURANT-12',
  zones: ['kitchen', 'prep-station', 'dining-room', 'dishwash'],
  shifts: ['pre-service', 'mid-service', 'post-close']
})

// Sanitize kitchen after dinner service
await foodService.sanitizeZone({
  zoneId: 'kitchen',
  shift: 'post-close',
  tasks: ['degrease-range', 'sanitize-prep-tables', 'mop-floors']
})

// Log completion
await foodService.logCleaningActivity({
  zoneId: 'kitchen',
  shift: 'post-close',
  completedBy: 'SW-014',
  completedAt: '2026-02-05T23:45:00Z'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert kitchen manager on overdue cleanings
foodService.zoneSanitized(async ({ zoneId }) => {
  const overdue = await foodService.findOverdueCleanings({ facilityId: 'RESTAURANT-12' })
  if (overdue.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'kitchen-manager',
      message: `${overdue.length} zones are overdue for cleaning`
    })
  }
})

// Prepare documentation before scheduled inspections
foodService.inspectionPassed(async ({ facilityId, nextInspection }) => {
  await scheduleTask({
    action: 'prepareForInspection',
    facilityId,
    scheduledDate: nextInspection
  })
})
```
