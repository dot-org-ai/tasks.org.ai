### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { cleanVehiclesVehicleComponents } from '@headlessly/clean-vehicles-vehicle-components'

const vehicles = cleanVehiclesVehicleComponents()

// Schedule a fleet wash
const order = await vehicles.scheduleWash({
  vehicleId: 'TRUCK-2247',
  servicePackage: 'full-detail',
  washBayId: 'BAY-3',
  scheduledTime: '2026-02-06T08:00:00Z'
})

// Execute cleaning steps
await vehicles.performExteriorWash({ orderId: order.id, method: 'touchless-auto' })
await vehicles.performInteriorDetail({ orderId: order.id, tasks: ['vacuum', 'wipe-surfaces', 'clean-glass'] })

// Inspect and return to service
const inspection = await vehicles.inspectVehicle({ orderId: order.id })
if (inspection.passed) {
  await vehicles.returnToService({ vehicleId: 'TRUCK-2247' })
}
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify dispatch when vehicles are ready
vehicles.vehicleReturnedToService(async ({ vehicleId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'dispatch',
    message: `Vehicle ${vehicleId} is clean and available for assignment`
  })
})

// Auto-schedule next wash based on mileage
vehicles.vehicleReturnedToService(async ({ vehicleId, mileage }) => {
  await vehicles.scheduleWash({
    vehicleId,
    triggerMileage: mileage + 5000,
    servicePackage: 'standard-wash'
  })
})
```
