# Clean Fabrics or Apparel

> Business-as-Code definition for washing, dry cleaning, and laundering fabrics, textiles, uniforms, linens, and apparel using commercial and industrial cleaning processes.

## Overview

Cleaning fabrics and apparel involves sorting items by fabric type and soil level, selecting the appropriate wash or dry clean program, processing through commercial washers and extractors, drying, folding or hanging, and performing quality checks. This definition models garment intake, sorting, wash formula selection, machine processing, drying, inspection, and packaging for commercial laundries, linen services, uniform rental companies, and hospitality operations.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { cleanFabricsApparel } from '@headlessly/clean-fabrics-apparel'

const laundry = cleanFabricsApparel()

// Sort incoming hotel linen delivery
await laundry.sortIncoming({
  clientId: 'GRAND-HOTEL-DOWNTOWN',
  items: [
    { type: 'king-sheets', quantity: 200, soil: 'normal' },
    { type: 'bath-towels', quantity: 350, soil: 'heavy' },
    { type: 'table-linens', quantity: 80, soil: 'stained' }
  ]
})

// Select formula and process
await laundry.selectWashFormula({
  loadId: 'LOAD-2026-0205-014',
  category: 'heavy-soil-white-cotton',
  formula: 'alkaline-break-bleach-sour',
  temperature: { fahrenheit: 160 }
})

await laundry.processWashLoad({
  loadId: 'LOAD-2026-0205-014',
  machineId: 'WASHER-EXTRACTOR-06',
  weight: { pounds: 120 }
})

// Dry and inspect
await laundry.dryItems({
  loadId: 'LOAD-2026-0205-014',
  method: 'tumble-dry-high',
  duration: { minutes: 45 }
})

await laundry.inspectCleanliness({
  loadId: 'LOAD-2026-0205-014',
  checks: ['stain-free', 'whiteness-level', 'fabric-integrity']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-rewash loads that fail inspection
laundry.cleanlinessInspected(async ({ loadId, passed, failures }) => {
  if (!passed) {
    await laundry.selectWashFormula({
      loadId,
      category: 'rewash-targeted',
      formula: failures.includes('stain') ? 'enzyme-presoak-rewash' : 'standard-rewash'
    })
  }
})

// Alert on high chemical consumption
laundry.chemicalUsageTracked(async ({ chemical, gallonsUsed, expectedGallons }) => {
  if (gallonsUsed > expectedGallons * 1.2) {
    await notify({
      to: 'laundry-manager',
      message: `${chemical} usage ${gallonsUsed} gal exceeds expected ${expectedGallons} gal by 20%+`
    })
  }
})
```
