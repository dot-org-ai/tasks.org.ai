## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { collectDirtyDishesTableware } from '@headlessly/collect-dirty-dishes-tableware'

const bussing = collectDirtyDishesTableware()

// Identify tables ready for clearing in the main dining room
const tables = await bussing.identifyTableToClear({
  zone: 'main-dining',
  status: 'needs-clearing'
})

// Clear a specific table
await bussing.clearTable({
  tableId: 'table-22',
  busserId: 'busser-03',
  busTubId: 'tub-15',
  items: ['dinner-plates-4', 'wine-glasses-4', 'silverware-set-4', 'linen-napkins-4']
})

// Sort and deliver to dish room
await bussing.sortServiceware({
  busTubId: 'tub-15',
  categories: {
    plates: 4,
    glassware: 4,
    silverware: 16,
    linen: 4
  }
})

await bussing.transportToDishRoom({
  busTubId: 'tub-15',
  destination: 'dish-room-main'
})

// Update table status for reset
await bussing.updateTableStatus({
  tableId: 'table-22',
  status: 'ready-to-reset'

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify setup crew when table is cleared for reset
bussing.tableStatusUpdated(async ({ tableId, status }) => {
  if (status === 'ready-to-reset') {
    await notify({
      to: 'setup-crew',
      message: `Table ${tableId} cleared and ready for reset`
    })
  }
})

// Alert supervisor when dish room queue backs up
bussing.dishesDelivered(async ({ dishRoomId }) => {
  const queue = await bussing.getDishRoomQueue({ dishRoomId })
  if (queue.pendingTubs > 10) {
    await notify({
      to: 'dining-room-supervisor',
      message: `Dish room ${dishRoomId} has ${queue.pendingTubs} tubs queued. Consider additional warewash staffing.`
    })
  }
})
```
