const dining = arrangeTablesDiningAreas()

// Configure the dining room for evening service
await dining.configureLayout({
  diningZone: 'main-dining-room',
  floorPlan: 'evening-standard-60-covers',
  tables: [
    { id: 'T1', type: 'round-8', position: { x: 2, y: 3 } },
    { id: 'T2', type: 'round-8', position: { x: 6, y: 3 } },
    { id: 'T3', type: 'rect-4', position: { x: 2, y: 7 } },
    { id: 'T4', type: 'rect-4', position: { x: 6, y: 7 } }
  ]
})

// Set formal place settings

  settingType: 'formal-dinner',
  components: ['charger-plate', 'dinner-fork', 'salad-fork', 'dinner-knife', 'soup-spoon', 'water-glass', 'wine-glass']
})

// Adjust for a large party reservation

  await notify({
    to: 'hostess-station',
    message: `${diningZone} is ready with ${totalCovers} covers available for seating`
  })
})

// Auto-reconfigure when large reservations are booked
dining.layoutAdjusted(async ({ diningZone, reason, newCapacity }) => {
