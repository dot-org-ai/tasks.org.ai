### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { serveFoodBeverages } from '@headlessly/serve-food-beverages'

const service = serveFoodBeverages()

// Take a guest order with allergy notes
const order = await service.takeOrder({
  tableId: 'table-14',
  serverId: 'server-08',
  items: [
    { menuItem: 'grilled-salmon', modifications: ['no-butter'], quantity: 1 },
    { menuItem: 'caesar-salad', modifications: ['dressing-on-side'], quantity: 2 },
    { menuItem: 'house-cabernet', quantity: 2 }
  ],
  allergyAlerts: ['shellfish', 'dairy']

await service.submitToKitchen({ orderId: order.id })

// Deliver and check satisfaction
await service.deliverFood({
  orderId: order.id,
  tableId: 'table-14',
  coursesDelivered: ['entree', 'salad']
})

await service.checkSatisfaction({

// Alert kitchen when allergy order is submitted
service.orderSubmitted(async ({ orderId, allergyAlerts }) => {
  if (allergyAlerts.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'kitchen-expo',
      message: `ALLERGY ALERT on order ${orderId}: ${allergyAlerts.join(', ')}`
    })
  }
})

// Track service timing for quality metrics
service.foodDelivered(async ({ orderId, tableId, deliveredAt }) => {
  const order = await service.findActiveOrders({ orderId })
  const waitMinutes = (deliveredAt - order.submittedAt) / 60000
  if (waitMinutes > 20) {
    await notify({
      to: 'dining-room-manager',
      message: `Table ${tableId} waited ${Math.round(waitMinutes)} minutes for food`
