```typescript
import { accompanyIndividualsGroupsActivities } from '@headlessly/accompany-individuals-groups-activities'

const activities = accompanyIndividualsGroupsActivities()

// Schedule a community recreation outing

  name: 'Community Pool Visit',
  location: 'Westside Aquatic Center',
  date: '2026-06-15',
  startTime: '10:00',
  duration: 120, // minutes
  participantIds: ['P-101', 'P-102', 'P-103', 'P-104']
})

// Confirm all participants have consent
await activities.confirmParticipation({ activityId: outing.id })

// Brief and escort group
await activities.briefParticipants({
  activityId: outing.id,
  safetyTopics: ['water safety', 'buddy system', 'emergency exits']

  for (const participantId of participantIds) {
    const profile = await getParticipant(participantId)
    await sendReminder({
      to: profile.guardianEmail,
      message: `${profile.name} has an upcoming activity on ${date}. Please confirm consent.`
    })
  }
})

// Flag missing consent forms before departure
activities.participationConfirmed(async ({ activityId, missingConsent }) => {
  if (missingConsent.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'program-coordinator',
      message: `Activity ${activityId} has ${missingConsent.length} participants without signed consent forms.`
