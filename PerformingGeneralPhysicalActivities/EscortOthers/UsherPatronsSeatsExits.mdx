const scan = await ushering.scanTicket({
  ticketCode: 'TKT-2026-0412-SEC-A-ROW-12-SEAT-5',

    await dispatch({
      to: 'security-team',
      section: sectionId,

  if (exitType === 'emergency') {
    await activateEvacuationPlan({ section: sectionId })
    await notify({
      to: 'head-usher',
