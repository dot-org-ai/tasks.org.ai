### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { provideEscortTransportation } from '@headlessly/provide-escort-transportation'

const transport = provideEscortTransportation()

// Submit a transport request for a medical appointment
const request = await transport.submitTransportRequest({
  passengerId: 'PAX-2024-0331',
  origin: '450 Oak Street, Apt 12',
  destination: 'Regional Medical Center',
  scheduledTime: '2026-05-10T09:00:00',
  specialNeeds: 'wheelchair-accessible'
})

// Assign a driver and vehicle
await transport.assignDriverAndVehicle({
  requestId: request.id,
  driverId: 'DRV-045',
  vehicleId: 'VAN-ADA-03'
})

// Execute the trip
await transport.confirmPickup({ requestId: request.id })
await transport.executeTransport({ requestId: request.id })
await transport.confirmDropoff({ requestId: request.id })
await transport.logTripDetails({
  requestId: request.id,
  mileage: 14.2,
  notes: 'Passenger delivered on time, no issues.'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify passenger when driver is assigned
transport.driverAssigned(async ({ requestId, driverId, vehicleId }) => {
  const request = await transport.findTransportRequests({ id: requestId })
  await sendNotification({
    to: request.passengerId,
    message: `Your transport has been confirmed. Driver ${driverId} will arrive at ${request.scheduledTime}.`
  })
})

// Alert fleet supervisor when vehicle mileage threshold is reached
transport.tripDetailsLogged(async ({ vehicleId, mileage }) => {
  const vehicle = await getVehicle(vehicleId)
  if (vehicle.totalMileage + mileage > vehicle.serviceThreshold) {
    await notify({
      to: 'fleet-supervisor',
      message: `Vehicle ${vehicleId} has exceeded its maintenance mileage threshold. Schedule service.`
    })
  }
})
```
