### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { escortPrisonersCourtroomsPrisonsFacilities } from '@headlessly/escort-prisoners-courtrooms-prisons-facilities'

const escorts = escortPrisonersCourtroomsPrisonsFacilities()

// Request a court appearance transport
const order = await escorts.requestTransport({
  prisonerId: 'INM-2024-4481',
  origin: 'County Detention Center',
  destination: 'Superior Court Room 3B',
  scheduledTime: '2026-03-15T08:30:00',

// Assign escort team and conduct screening
await escorts.assignEscortTeam({
  transportOrderId: order.id,
  officers: ['OFF-112', 'OFF-118'],
  vehicle: 'TRANS-VAN-07'
})

await escorts.conductSecurityScreening({ transportOrderId: order.id })

  await notify({
    to: 'court-clerk',
    message: `Prisoner ${prisonerId} has departed. ETA: ${estimatedArrival}`
  })
})

// Escalate high-severity incidents to shift supervisor

    await escalate({
      to: 'shift-supervisor',
      subject: `Transport incident on order ${transportOrderId}`,
