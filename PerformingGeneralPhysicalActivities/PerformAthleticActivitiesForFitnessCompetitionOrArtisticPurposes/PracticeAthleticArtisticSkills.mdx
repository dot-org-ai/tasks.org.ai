## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { practiceAthleticArtisticSkills } from '@headlessly/practice-athletic-artistic-skills'

const practice = practiceAthleticArtisticSkills()

// Assess current skill levels
const assessment = await practice.assessCurrentSkills({
  athleteId: 'ATH-0042',
  skillAreas: ['balance', 'technique', 'endurance', 'flexibility'],
  assessmentDate: '2026-02-01'
})

// Create a weekly practice plan
const plan = await practice.createPracticePlan({
  athleteId: 'ATH-0042',
  weekStartDate: '2026-02-03',
  sessions: [
    { day: 'monday', focus: 'technique', durationMinutes: 90 },
    { day: 'wednesday', focus: 'endurance', durationMinutes: 60 },
    { day: 'friday', focus: 'balance', durationMinutes: 75 }
  ]
})

// Record session outcome
await practice.recordSessionOutcome({
  sessionId: plan.sessions[0].id,
  drillsCompleted: 8,
  performanceNotes: 'Improved footwork consistency by 15%'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-evaluate progress after every fifth session
practice.sessionOutcomeRecorded(async ({ athleteId, sessionCount }) => {
  if (sessionCount % 5 === 0) {
    await practice.evaluateProgress({
      athleteId,
      periodWeeks: 2
    })
  }
})

// Alert coach when progress stalls
practice.progressEvaluated(async ({ athleteId, skillArea, trend }) => {
  if (trend === 'plateau') {
    await notify({
      to: 'head-coach',
      message: `${athleteId} showing plateau in ${skillArea}. Training plan adjustment recommended.`
    })
  }
})
```
