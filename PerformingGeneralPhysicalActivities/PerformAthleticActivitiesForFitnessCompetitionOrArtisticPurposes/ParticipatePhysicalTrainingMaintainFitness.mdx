## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { participatePhysicalTrainingMaintainFitness } from '@headlessly/participate-physical-training-maintain-fitness'

const training = participatePhysicalTrainingMaintainFitness()

// Conduct an initial fitness assessment
const assessment = await training.conductFitnessAssessment({
  traineeId: 'EMP-1045',
  tests: ['pushups', 'situps', 'mile-run', 'flexibility'],
  assessmentDate: '2026-01-15'
})

// Create a fitness program based on assessment
const program = await training.createFitnessProgram({
  traineeId: 'EMP-1045',
  goal: 'occupational-readiness',
  weeklySessionCount: 4,
  durationWeeks: 12,
  focusAreas: ['cardiovascular', 'upper-body-strength']
})

// Log a completed workout
await training.logExerciseActivity({
  traineeId: 'EMP-1045',
  programId: program.id,
  exercises: [
    { name: 'running', distanceMiles: 3, durationMinutes: 24 },
    { name: 'pushups', sets: 3, reps: 25 },
    { name: 'planks', sets: 3, durationSeconds: 60 }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-evaluate progress at program midpoint
training.workoutSessionExecuted(async ({ traineeId, programId, sessionNumber, totalSessions }) => {
  if (sessionNumber === Math.floor(totalSessions / 2)) {
    await training.evaluateFitnessProgress({
      traineeId,
      programId,
      periodLabel: 'midpoint'
    })
  }
})

// Alert coordinator when fitness standards are not met
training.fitnessProgressEvaluated(async ({ traineeId, meetsStandards, deficientAreas }) => {
  if (!meetsStandards) {
    await notify({
      to: 'fitness-coordinator',
      message: `${traineeId} below standards in: ${deficientAreas.join(', ')}. Program adjustment needed.`
    })
  }
})
```
