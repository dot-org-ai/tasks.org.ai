## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { provideSecurityEscortsOfficialsJury } from '@headlessly/provide-security-escorts-officials-jury'

const escorts = provideSecurityEscortsOfficialsJury()

// Process an escort request for a jury panel
const request = await escorts.processEscortRequest({
  principalType: 'jury-panel',
  principalCount: 12,
  origin: 'County Courthouse, Room 4B',
  destination: 'Sequestered Hotel',
  requestedDate: '2026-03-10',
  requestedBy: 'court-administration'
})

// Conduct threat assessment
const assessment = await escorts.conductThreatAssessment({
  requestId: request.id,
  threatLevel: 'elevated',
  knownThreats: ['media-exposure', 'case-related-intimidation']
})

// Plan the escort route
await escorts.planEscortRoute({
  requestId: request.id,
  primaryRoute: 'courthouse-to-hotel-route-A',
  alternateRoute: 'courthouse-to-hotel-route-B',
  checkpoints: ['parking-garage-exit', 'highway-on-ramp', 'hotel-entrance']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-assign detail when route is planned
escorts.escortRoutePlanned(async ({ requestId, threatLevel }) => {
  const teamSize = threatLevel === 'elevated' ? 4 : 2
  await escorts.assignEscortDetail({
    requestId,
    agentCount: teamSize,
    vehicleCount: Math.ceil(teamSize / 2)
  })
})

// Alert command on incident during escort
escorts.escortIncidentReported(async ({ requestId, incidentType, location }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'security-command',
    message: `Incident during escort ${requestId}: ${incidentType} at ${location}. Immediate response required.`
  })
})
```
