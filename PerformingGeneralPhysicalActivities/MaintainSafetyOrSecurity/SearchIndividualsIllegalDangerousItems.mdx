## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { searchIndividualsIllegalDangerousItems } from '@headlessly/search-individuals-illegal-dangerous-items'

const screening = searchIndividualsIllegalDangerousItems()

// Authorize a search at a checkpoint
const auth = await screening.authorizeSearch({
  subjectId: 'individual-3847',
  basis: 'checkpoint-policy',
  location: 'terminal-b-security'
})

// Operate a screening device
const scanResult = await screening.operateScreeningDevice({
  authorizationId: auth.id,
  deviceId: 'xray-scanner-04',
  subjectId: 'individual-3847'
})

// Seize a prohibited item
await screening.seizeItem({
  searchRecordId: scanResult.searchRecordId,
  itemDescription: 'Concealed folding knife - 4 inch blade',
  category: 'weapon',
  location: 'carry-on-bag'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert supervisor on prohibited item discovery
screening.prohibitedItemFound(async ({ searchRecordId, category, subjectId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'supervising-officer',
    message: `${category} found on subject ${subjectId} - search record ${searchRecordId}`
  })
})

// Log screening throughput metrics
screening.screeningCompleted(async ({ location, timestamp }) => {
  await metrics.increment('screening.completed', {
    tags: { location },
    timestamp
  })
})
```
