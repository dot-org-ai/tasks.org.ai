## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainPublicOrderSecurity } from '@headlessly/maintain-public-order-security'

const publicSafety = maintainPublicOrderSecurity()

// Deploy security for a public event
await publicSafety.deploySecurityPersonnel({
  eventId: 'city-marathon-2026',
  zones: [
    { zoneId: 'start-line', officers: 12, type: 'crowd-control' },
    { zoneId: 'route-midpoint', officers: 8, type: 'patrol' },
    { zoneId: 'finish-area', officers: 15, type: 'crowd-control' }
  ]
})

// Assess crowd conditions during the event
const assessment = await publicSafety.assessCrowdConditions({
  eventId: 'city-marathon-2026',
  zoneId: 'finish-area',
  estimatedAttendees: 25000,
  mood: 'positive'
})

// Respond to a developing situation
await publicSafety.respondToDisturbance({
  eventId: 'city-marathon-2026',
  location: 'finish-area-south-entrance',
  type: 'overcrowding',
  severity: 'medium'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Request mutual aid when disturbance severity is high
publicSafety.disturbanceDetected(async ({ eventId, severity, location }) => {
  if (severity === 'high') {
    await publicSafety.coordinateWithAgencies({
      eventId,
      request: 'mutual-aid',
      resourcesNeeded: 'additional-officers',
      location
    })
  }
})

// Issue public advisory on crowd risk escalation
publicSafety.crowdConditionsAssessed(async ({ eventId, zoneId, riskLevel }) => {
  if (riskLevel === 'elevated') {
    await publicSafety.issuePublicAdvisory({
      eventId,
      message: `Congestion in ${zoneId} - please use alternate entrances`,
      channels: ['public-address', 'social-media', 'mobile-alert']
    })
  }
})
```
