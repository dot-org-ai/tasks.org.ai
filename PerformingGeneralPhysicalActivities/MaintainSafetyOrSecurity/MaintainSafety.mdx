|------|-------------|
| SafetyOfficer | Leads safety inspections and enforces protocols |
| FacilityManager | Oversees building and site conditions |
| SafetyCommitteeMember | Participates in safety reviews and policy development |
| IncidentCoordinator | Manages response when a safety event occurs |

## Entities

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| SafetyInspection | Scheduled or ad-hoc review of conditions and compliance |
| Hazard | An identified risk to health or physical safety |
| SafetyProtocol | Documented procedure for preventing or responding to hazards |
| IncidentReport | Record of a safety event including details and resolution |
| CorrectiveAction | Step taken to eliminate or mitigate a hazard |
| SafetyEquipment | Protective gear or device used to reduce risk |

## Actions

| Action | Description |

| issueCorrectiveAction | Assign and track remediation for an identified hazard |
| reportIncident | Document a safety event with details and context |
| updateSafetyPlan | Revise safety protocols based on new findings |
| verifyCompliance | Confirm that corrective actions and protocols are in effect |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| inspectionCompleted | A safety inspection has been finished and documented |
| hazardIdentified | A new hazard has been discovered and classified |
| protocolEnforced | A safety protocol has been actively enforced |
| correctiveActionIssued | A remediation task has been assigned for a hazard |
| incidentReported | A safety event has been formally documented |
| safetyPlanUpdated | Safety protocols have been revised |
| complianceVerified | Corrective actions have been confirmed as effective |

## Searches

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainSafety } from '@headlessly/maintain-safety'

const safety = maintainSafety()

// Conduct a routine facility inspection
const inspection = await safety.conductInspection({
  area: 'warehouse-b',
  type: 'routine',
  inspector: 'officer-martinez'
})

// Log a discovered hazard
const hazard = await safety.identifyHazard({
  inspectionId: inspection.id,
  description: 'Exposed wiring near loading dock entrance',
  severity: 'high',
  location: 'warehouse-b-dock-3'
})

// Issue a corrective action
await safety.issueCorrectiveAction({
  hazardId: hazard.id,
  assignee: 'facilities-team',
  deadline: '2026-02-10',
  action: 'Replace exposed wiring conduit and install protective covers'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify management on high-severity hazards
safety.hazardIdentified(async ({ hazardId, severity, location }) => {
  if (severity === 'high' || severity === 'critical') {
    await notify({
      to: 'safety-committee',
      message: `High-severity hazard at ${location} requires immediate attention`
    })
  }
})

// Schedule re-inspection after corrective action
safety.correctiveActionIssued(async ({ hazardId, deadline }) => {
  await safety.conductInspection({
    area: hazardId,
    type: 'follow-up',
    scheduledDate: deadline
  })
})
```
