## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { confiscateProhibitedDangerousItems } from '@headlessly/confiscate-prohibited-dangerous-items'

const confiscation = confiscateProhibitedDangerousItems()

// Seize a prohibited item
const item = await confiscation.seizeItem({
  holderId: 'individual-5523',
  description: 'Unregistered firearm - 9mm handgun',
  category: 'weapon',
  location: 'checkpoint-alpha',
  officerId: 'officer-park'
})

// Document and issue receipt
await confiscation.documentConfiscation({
  itemId: item.id,
  caseId: 'case-20260205-017',
  circumstances: 'Found during routine security screening'
})

await confiscation.issueReceipt({
  itemId: item.id,
  holderId: 'individual-5523'
})

// Secure in evidence storage
await confiscation.secureInEvidence({
  itemId: item.id,
  storageLocation: 'evidence-locker-b-14',
  custodianId: 'custodian-reyes'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify law enforcement on weapon seizure
confiscation.itemSeized(async ({ itemId, category, holderId }) => {
  if (category === 'weapon') {
    await confiscation.transferToAuthority({
      itemId,
      agency: 'local-police-dept',
      priority: 'immediate'
    })
  }
})

// Schedule destruction for perishable contraband
confiscation.itemSecured(async ({ itemId, category }) => {
  if (category === 'controlled-substance') {
    await confiscation.orderDisposition({
      itemId,
      action: 'destroy',
      scheduledDate: new Date(Date.now() + 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000).toISOString()
    })
  }
})
```
