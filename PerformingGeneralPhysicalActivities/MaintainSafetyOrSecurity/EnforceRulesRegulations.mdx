## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { enforceRulesRegulations } from '@headlessly/enforce-rules-regulations'

const enforcement = enforceRulesRegulations()

// Conduct a compliance check
const report = await enforcement.conductComplianceCheck({
  subjectId: 'facility-1234',
  ruleSet: 'fire-safety-code-2025',
  inspector: 'officer-chen'
})

// Issue a citation for a detected violation
const citation = await enforcement.issueCitation({
  violationId: 'viol-8821',
  subjectId: 'facility-1234',
  rule: 'FSC-4.2.1',
  description: 'Emergency exits blocked by stored materials',
  deadline: '2026-02-15'
})

// Assess a penalty
await enforcement.assessPenalty({
  citationId: citation.id,
  type: 'fine',
  amount: 5000,
  currency: 'USD'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify compliance manager on serious violations
enforcement.violationDetected(async ({ violationId, severity, subjectId }) => {
  if (severity === 'critical') {
    await notify({
      to: 'compliance-manager',
      message: `Critical violation ${violationId} detected for ${subjectId}`
    })
    await enforcement.escalateViolation({ violationId })
  }
})

// Auto-close case when penalty is paid
enforcement.penaltyAssessed(async ({ citationId, status }) => {
  if (status === 'paid') {
    await enforcement.closeCase({ citationId })
  }
})
```
