# Unload Materials or Equipment

> Business-as-Code definition for receiving and unloading materials and equipment from trucks, railcars, containers, and vessels at warehouses, job sites, and receiving docks.

## Overview

Unloading materials or equipment involves scheduling inbound deliveries, assigning dock doors or unloading areas, operating forklifts, cranes, and conveyors to remove items from vehicles, inspecting for damage, and recording received quantities. This definition models receiving scheduling, unloading crew coordination, damage inspection, quantity verification, and inventory put-away for distribution centers, manufacturing plants, and field receiving operations.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { unloadMaterialsEquipment } from '@headlessly/unload-materials-equipment'

const receiving = unloadMaterialsEquipment()

// Schedule an inbound delivery
const appointment = await receiving.scheduleArrival({
  warehouseId: 'DC-WEST-02',
  carrierId: 'XPO-LOGISTICS',
  date: '2026-02-07',
  dock: 'DOOR-12',
  purchaseOrders: ['PO-2026-5571', 'PO-2026-5572']
})

// Check in and unload
await receiving.checkInVehicle({
  appointmentId: appointment.id,
  sealNumber: 'SEAL-XPO-44891',
  bolNumber: 'BOL-XPO-2026-7821'
})

await receiving.unloadItems({
  appointmentId: appointment.id,
  method: 'forklift',
  palletCount: 22
})

// Inspect and tally
const inspection = await receiving.inspectForDamage({
  appointmentId: appointment.id,
  items: 22
})

await receiving.tallyReceivedQuantity({
  appointmentId: appointment.id,
  expected: 22,
  received: 21,
  discrepancy: { type: 'shortage', count: 1 }
})

// Sign off and put away
await receiving.signProofOfDelivery({ appointmentId: appointment.id })
await receiving.directPutAway({
  appointmentId: appointment.id,
  locations: [
    { pallets: 12, zone: 'RACK-A-ROW-14' },
    { pallets: 9, zone: 'RACK-B-ROW-22' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-file damage claim when damage is found
receiving.damageInspected(async ({ appointmentId, damageFound, items }) => {
  if (damageFound) {
    await notify({
      to: 'claims-coordinator',
      message: `Delivery ${appointmentId} has ${items.length} damaged items - initiate carrier claim`
    })
  }
})

// Alert procurement on quantity shortages
receiving.quantityTallied(async ({ appointmentId, discrepancy }) => {
  if (discrepancy && discrepancy.type === 'shortage') {
    await notify({
      to: 'procurement',
      message: `Delivery ${appointmentId} short ${discrepancy.count} units - contact supplier`
    })
  }
})
```
