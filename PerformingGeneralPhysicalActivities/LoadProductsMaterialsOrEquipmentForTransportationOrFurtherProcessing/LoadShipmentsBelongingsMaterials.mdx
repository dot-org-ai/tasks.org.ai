## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { loadShipmentsBelongingsMaterials } from '@headlessly/load-shipments-belongings-materials'

const loading = loadShipmentsBelongingsMaterials()

// Schedule a dock slot for an outbound shipment
const slot = await loading.scheduleDockSlot({
  warehouseId: 'DC-EAST-01',
  bay: 'DOCK-14',
  carrierId: 'FEDEX-FREIGHT',
  window: { start: '2026-02-06T08:00', end: '2026-02-06T10:00' }
})

// Stage and verify
await loading.stageItems({
  slotId: slot.id,
  orders: ['ORD-44521', 'ORD-44522', 'ORD-44530'],
  palletCount: 18
})

await loading.verifyShipment({
  slotId: slot.id,
  bolNumber: 'BOL-2026-02-0891'
})

// Load and seal
await loading.loadVehicle({
  slotId: slot.id,
  trailerId: 'TRL-FEDEX-7744',
  method: 'forklift'
})

await loading.sealContainer({
  trailerId: 'TRL-FEDEX-7744',
  sealNumbers: ['SEAL-A9921', 'SEAL-A9922']
})

await loading.confirmDeparture({ slotId: slot.id })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-notify carrier when staging is complete
loading.itemsStaged(async ({ slotId, carrierId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: carrierId,
    message: `Dock slot ${slotId} staged and ready for loading`
  })
})

// Alert dispatch on weight issues
loading.loadBalanced(async ({ trailerId, axleWeights, overLimit }) => {
  if (overLimit) {
    await notify({
      to: 'dispatch',
      message: `Trailer ${trailerId} exceeds axle weight limits - redistribution required`
    })
  }
})
```
