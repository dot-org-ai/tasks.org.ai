# Assist Skilled Construction or Extraction Personnel

> Business-as-Code definition for providing labor support to skilled tradespeople and extraction workers by carrying materials, holding components, operating simple equipment, and maintaining a clean and safe work area.

## Overview

Assisting skilled construction and extraction personnel involves performing support tasks that enable journeymen, operators, and specialists to focus on their craft. This includes fetching tools and materials, holding workpieces in position, mixing mortar or grout, operating basic equipment, and cleaning up after each phase of work. This definition models task delegation, tool and material staging, hands-on assistance, progress tracking, and workforce development coordination for construction helper and laborer roles.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { assistSkilledConstructionExtractionPersonnel } from '@headlessly/assist-skilled-construction-extraction-personnel'

const helper = assistSkilledConstructionExtractionPersonnel()

// Receive task assignment from a mason
await helper.receiveTaskAssignment({
  projectId: 'BRICK-FACADE-BLDG-12',
  journeymanId: 'MASON-RODRIGUEZ-03',
  task: 'stage-brick-and-mortar',
  area: 'east-wall-scaffold-level-2'
})

// Stage materials and assist
await helper.stageToolsAndMaterials({
  projectId: 'BRICK-FACADE-BLDG-12',
  tools: ['brick-tongs', 'mortar-hod', 'level'],
  materials: [
    { type: 'face-brick', quantity: 200, unit: 'each' },
    { type: 'mortar-bags', quantity: 6, unit: 'bags' }
  ]
})

await helper.mixMaterials({
  projectId: 'BRICK-FACADE-BLDG-12',
  recipe: 'type-S-mortar',
  quantity: { bags: 2 },
  waterRatio: 'per-bag-instructions'
})

await helper.assistWithInstallation({
  projectId: 'BRICK-FACADE-BLDG-12',
  task: 'feed-brick-to-mason',
  duration: { hours: 3 }
})

await helper.logDailyProgress({
  helperId: 'LABORER-CHEN-11',
  date: '2026-02-05',
  tasksCompleted: ['material-staging', 'mortar-mixing', 'brick-feeding'],
  apprenticeshipHours: 8
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-log apprenticeship hours when daily progress is recorded
helper.dailyProgressLogged(async ({ helperId, apprenticeshipHours }) => {
  if (apprenticeshipHours > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'training-coordinator',
      message: `Helper ${helperId} logged ${apprenticeshipHours} OJT hours - update apprenticeship record`
    })
  }
})

// Alert foreman when materials run low at the work area
helper.toolsAndMaterialsStaged(async ({ projectId, materials }) => {
  const lowStock = materials.filter(m => m.remaining < m.quantity * 0.2)
  if (lowStock.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'trade-foreman',
      message: `Project ${projectId} running low on: ${lowStock.map(m => m.type).join(', ')}`
    })
  }
})
```
