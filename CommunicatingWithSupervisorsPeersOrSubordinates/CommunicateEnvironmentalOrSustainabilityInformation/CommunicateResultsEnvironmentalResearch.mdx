# Communicate Results of Environmental Research

> Business-as-Code definition for communicating results of environmental research. Models the dissemination process where environmental scientists, researchers, and consultants share study findings, field data, and analytical conclusions with colleagues, management, regulatory agencies, and the broader scientific community.

## Overview

Communicating results of environmental research involves preparing scientific reports, presenting findings at conferences, submitting data to regulatory bodies, publishing in peer-reviewed journals, and briefing internal stakeholders on research outcomes. This definition covers ecological survey results, contamination assessments, biodiversity studies, and climate change research findings, enabling research teams to effectively share environmental knowledge and inform evidence-based decision-making across organizational and regulatory contexts.

## Actors

| Actor | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ScientificCommunity | Peer researchers who review and build upon environmental findings |
| RegulatoryAgency | Government bodies that use research data for policy and enforcement |
| FundingOrganization | Entities that sponsored the research and require outcome reports |
| PolicyMaker | Decision-makers who rely on research findings for environmental policy |
| AcademicJournal | Publications that disseminate peer-reviewed environmental research |

## Roles

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { communicateResultsEnvironmentalResearch } from '@headlessly/communicate-results-environmental-research'

const envResearch = communicateResultsEnvironmentalResearch()

// Prepare and submit a research report
await envResearch.prepareResearchReport({
  title: 'Microplastic Contamination in Great Lakes Tributaries',
  study: 'GL-MP-2025',
  methodology: 'field-sampling-spectroscopy',
  findings: [
    { metric: 'microplastic-concentration', value: 4.2, unit: 'particles-per-liter', trend: 'increasing' },
    { metric: 'dominant-polymer-type', value: 'polyethylene', percentage: 62 }
  ],
  recommendations: ['enhanced-wastewater-filtration', 'upstream-source-reduction']
})

// Brief stakeholders on results
await envResearch.briefStakeholders({
  study: 'GL-MP-2025',
  audience: ['research-director', 'epa-liaison', 'grant-program-officer'],
  format: 'executive-summary',
  keyFindings: 'Microplastic levels 40% higher than 2020 baseline'
})

// Submit to journal
await envResearch.submitJournalManuscript({
  study: 'GL-MP-2025',
  journal: 'Environmental Science & Technology',
  manuscriptType: 'research-article',
  coAuthors: ['dr-chen', 'dr-martinez', 'dr-okafor']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify funders when reports are completed
envResearch.researchReportPrepared(async ({ study, title }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'funding-organization',
    message: `Research report completed for ${study}: ${title}`
  })
})

// Auto-prepare policy brief after regulatory filing
envResearch.regulatoryReportFiled(async ({ study, agency }) => {
  await envResearch.preparePolicyBrief({ study, targetAudience: 'legislative-staff' })
})
```
