# Communicate Green Energy Production Information

> Business-as-Code definition for communicating green energy production information. Models the reporting and dissemination process where energy professionals share renewable energy output data, grid integration metrics, sustainability performance, and clean energy project updates with internal teams, regulators, and external stakeholders.

## Overview

Communicating green energy production information involves reporting renewable energy output metrics, sharing grid integration data, presenting sustainability performance against targets, and disseminating clean energy project status updates. This definition covers solar and wind farm production reports, renewable energy certificate documentation, carbon offset communications, and utility interconnection status updates, enabling energy organizations to maintain transparency about green energy operations and demonstrate progress toward sustainability commitments.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { communicateGreenEnergyProductionInformation } from '@headlessly/communicate-green-energy-production-information'

const greenEnergy = communicateGreenEnergyProductionInformation()

// Report monthly production
await greenEnergy.reportProduction({
  facility: 'Clearwater Solar Farm',
  period: { month: '2026-01', year: 2026 },
  output: { value: 12450, unit: 'MWh' },
  capacityFactor: 0.22,
  energyType: 'solar-photovoltaic'
})

// Issue renewable energy certificates
await greenEnergy.issueRenewableCertificates({
  facility: 'Clearwater Solar Farm',
  production: { value: 12450, unit: 'MWh' },
  certificateType: 'REC',
  vintage: '2026-01'
})

// File quarterly compliance report
await greenEnergy.fileComplianceReport({
  reportingBody: 'State Energy Commission',
  period: 'Q4-2025',
  facilities: ['Clearwater Solar Farm', 'Highland Wind Array'],
  totalOutput: { value: 45200, unit: 'MWh' },
  renewablePortfolioStandard: { target: 30, actual: 34, unit: 'percent' }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert investors when production milestones are reached
greenEnergy.productionReported(async ({ facility, output }) => {
  if (output.value > 10000) {
    await notify({
      to: 'investor-relations',
      message: `${facility} produced ${output.value} ${output.unit} this period`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-file compliance when period ends
greenEnergy.carbonOffsetDataPublished(async ({ facility, period }) => {
  await greenEnergy.fileComplianceReport({ facility, period })
})
```
