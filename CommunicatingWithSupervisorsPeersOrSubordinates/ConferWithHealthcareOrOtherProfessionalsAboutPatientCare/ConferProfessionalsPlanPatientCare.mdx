### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { conferProfessionalsPlanPatientCare } from '@headlessly/confer-professionals-plan-patient-care'

const carePlanning = conferProfessionalsPlanPatientCare()

// Schedule interprofessional conference
const conference = await carePlanning.scheduleConference({
  patientId: 'patient-789',
  date: '2026-02-25',
  time: '10:00',
  duration: 60,
  urgency: 'routine'
})

// Invite care team participants
await carePlanning.inviteParticipants({
  conferenceId: conference.id,
  participants: [
    { providerId: 'physician-123', role: 'Primary Physician' },
    { providerId: 'specialist-456', role: 'Cardiology Consult' },
    { providerId: 'nurse-789', role: 'Nursing Lead' },
    { providerId: 'therapist-101', role: 'Physical Therapy' }

})

// Share clinical assessment
await carePlanning.shareAssessment({
  conferenceId: conference.id,
  assessment: {
    diagnosis: 'Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction',
    currentStatus: 'Stable, improving functional capacity',
    concerns: ['medication adherence', 'exercise tolerance']
  }
})

// Propose intervention and finalize care plan
await carePlanning.proposeIntervention({
  conferenceId: conference.id,
  proposedBy: 'specialist-456',
  intervention: {
    type: 'medication adjustment',
    details: 'Increase beta-blocker dosage',
    rationale: 'Improved heart rate control'

const carePlan = await carePlanning.finalizeCarePlan({
  conferenceId: conference.id,
  goals: ['Improve exercise tolerance', 'Optimize medication regimen'],
  interventions: ['medication adjustment', 'physical therapy 3x/week']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-share assessments before conference
carePlanning.participantsInvited(async ({ conferenceId, participants }) => {
  const assessments = await getRecentAssessments({ conferenceId })
  await carePlanning.shareAssessment({
    conferenceId,
    assessment: assessments
  })
})

// Track unresolved discussions
carePlanning.optionsDiscussed(async ({ conferenceId, consensus }) => {
  if (!consensus) {
    await notify({
      to: 'care-coordinator',
      message: `Conference ${conferenceId} requires additional input for consensus`
    })
  }
})
```
