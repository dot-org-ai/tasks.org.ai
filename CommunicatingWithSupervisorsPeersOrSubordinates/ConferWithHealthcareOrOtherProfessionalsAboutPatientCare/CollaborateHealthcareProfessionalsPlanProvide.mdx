## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { collaborateHealthcareProfessionalsPlanProvide } from '@headlessly/collaborate-healthcare-professionals-plan-provide'

const careTeam = collaborateHealthcareProfessionalsPlanProvide()

// Convene interdisciplinary care team
const meeting = await careTeam.conveneCareteam({
  patientId: 'patient-12345',
  primaryCondition: 'Type 2 Diabetes with Cardiovascular Complications',
  teamMembers: [
    { providerId: 'doc-111', role: 'Endocrinologist', specialty: 'Diabetes Management' },
    { providerId: 'doc-222', role: 'Cardiologist', specialty: 'Heart Disease' },
    { providerId: 'nurse-333', role: 'Diabetes Educator', specialty: 'Patient Education' },
    { providerId: 'dietitian-444', role: 'Clinical Nutritionist', specialty: 'Dietary Therapy' }
  ],
  scheduledDate: '2026-02-10T10:00:00Z',
  objectives: ['Develop integrated treatment plan', 'Coordinate medication management', 'Establish monitoring protocols']
})

// Share clinical insights during meeting
await careTeam.shareClinicalInsights({
  meetingId: meeting.id,
  insights: [
    {
      providerId: 'doc-111',
      findings: 'HbA1c elevated at 8.2%, requiring intensified glycemic control',
      recommendations: ['Increase metformin dose', 'Add GLP-1 agonist']
    },
    {
      providerId: 'doc-222',
      findings: 'Echocardiogram shows reduced ejection fraction at 45%',
      recommendations: ['Initiate ACE inhibitor', 'Limit sodium intake', 'Monitor fluid status']
    },
    {
      providerId: 'dietitian-444',
      findings: 'Current diet high in refined carbohydrates and sodium',
      recommendations: ['Develop low-glycemic meal plan', 'Reduce sodium to < 2000mg/day']
    }
  ]
})

// Develop integrated treatment protocol
const protocol = await careTeam.developTreatmentProtocol({
  meetingId: meeting.id,
  protocolComponents: [
    {
      category: 'pharmacotherapy',
      interventions: ['Metformin 1000mg BID', 'Liraglutide 1.2mg daily', 'Lisinopril 10mg daily'],
      responsibleProvider: 'doc-111'
    },
    {
      category: 'nutrition',
      interventions: ['Carbohydrate counting education', 'Heart-healthy meal planning'],

    },
    {
      category: 'monitoring',
      interventions: ['Daily home glucose checks', 'Weekly weight tracking', 'Monthly HbA1c labs'],
      responsibleProvider: 'nurse-333'
    }
  ],
  targetOutcomes: {
    HbA1c: { target: '<7.0%', timeline: '3 months' },
    ejectionFraction: { target: '>50%', timeline: '6 months' },
    weight: { target: 'Reduce 10 lbs', timeline: '3 months' }
  }
})

// Coordinate intervention timing
await careTeam.coordinateInterventions({
  protocolId: protocol.id,
  schedule: [
    { week: 1, activities: ['Initiate medications', 'Nutrition consultation', 'Establish monitoring'] },
    { week: 4, activities: ['Review glucose logs', 'Assess medication tolerance', 'Adjust diet plan'] },
    { week: 12, activities: ['Repeat HbA1c', 'Cardiology follow-up', 'Evaluate target progress'] }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-notify team when treatment progress review shows concerning trends
careTeam.treatmentProgressReviewed(async ({ patientId, outcomes, targetOutcomes }) => {
  const concerningTrends = outcomes.filter(outcome =>
    outcome.trend === 'worsening' || outcome.variance > 20
  )

  if (concerningTrends.length > 0) {
    await notifyCareteam({
      patientId,
      priority: 'high',
      message: `${concerningTrends.length} concerning trends identified in treatment progress`,
      requestUrgentReview: true
    })
  }
})

// Track care plan adjustments and trigger re-coordination
careTeam.carePlanAdjusted(async ({ protocolId, modifications }) => {
  if (modifications.some(mod => mod.type === 'medication-change')) {
    await careTeam.coordinateInterventions({
      protocolId,
      notifyPharmacy: true,
      updateMonitoringSchedule: true
    })
  }
})
```
