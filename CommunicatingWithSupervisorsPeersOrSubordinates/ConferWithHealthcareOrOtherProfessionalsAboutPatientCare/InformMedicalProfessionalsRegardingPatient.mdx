## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { informMedicalProfessionalsRegardingPatient } from '@headlessly/inform-medical-professionals-regarding-patient'

const patientInfo = informMedicalProfessionalsRegardingPatient()

// Report routine patient status
const update = await patientInfo.reportStatus({
  patientId: 'patient-789',
  providerId: 'physician-123',
  status: {
    vitals: { temp: 98.6, bp: '120/80', hr: 72, spo2: 98 },
    condition: 'Stable, alert and oriented',
    painLevel: 2,
    timestamp: '2026-02-20T14:30:00Z'
  }
})

// Notify of significant condition change
await patientInfo.notifyChange({
  patientId: 'patient-789',
  change: {
    type: 'respiratory distress',
    severity: 'moderate',
    onset: '2026-02-20T16:45:00Z',
    interventions: ['oxygen increased to 4L', 'physician notified']
  }
})

// Escalate urgent situation
await patientInfo.escalateUrgent({
  patientId: 'patient-789',
  providerId: 'on-call-456',
  alert: {
    urgency: 'critical',
    issue: 'Rapid response activated for altered mental status',
    actions: ['Team responding', 'Code cart at bedside']
  }
})

// Conduct shift handoff
await patientInfo.conductHandoff({
  patientId: 'patient-789',
  from: { providerId: 'nurse-101', shift: 'day' },
  to: { providerId: 'nurse-202', shift: 'evening' },
  summary: {
    status: 'Stable post-procedure',
    pending: ['Lab results due at 20:00', 'Pain reassessment in 2 hours'],
    concerns: ['Monitor for post-procedure complications']
  }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-escalate critical changes
patientInfo.changeNotified(async ({ patientId, change }) => {
  if (change.severity === 'critical' || change.severity === 'severe') {
    await patientInfo.escalateUrgent({
      patientId,
      providerId: 'attending-physician',
      alert: {
        urgency: 'immediate',
        issue: change.type,
        actions: change.interventions
      }
    })
  }
})

// Track unconfirmed urgent alerts
patientInfo.urgentEscalated(async ({ patientId, providerId, alert }) => {
  await wait({ minutes: 5 })
  const delivery = await patientInfo.getUrgentAlerts({ patientId })
  const unconfirmed = delivery.filter(a => !a.confirmed)
  if (unconfirmed.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'nursing-supervisor',
      message: `Urgent alert for ${patientId} not confirmed after 5 minutes`
    })
  }
})
```
