```typescript
// Auto-escalate when critical needs are identified
assessment.disciplineEvaluationConducted(async ({ findings, discipline }) => {
  if (findings.riskLevel === 'critical' || findings.safety Concerns) {
    await escalateToCrisisTeam({
      assessmentId: findings.assessmentId,
      discipline,
      urgency: 'immediate',
      findings: findings.safetyConcerns
    })
  }
})

// Notify case manager when integrated plan is ready
assessment.integratedPlanDeveloped(async ({ assessmentId, clientId, planComponents }) => {
  await notifyServiceNavigator({
    clientId,
    message: `Integrated care plan ready with ${planComponents.length} components`,
    nextSteps: 'Schedule client meeting to review plan and initiate services'
  })
})
