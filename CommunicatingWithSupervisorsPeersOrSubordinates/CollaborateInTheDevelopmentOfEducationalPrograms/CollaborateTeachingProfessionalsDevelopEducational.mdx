## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { collaborateTeachingProfessionalsDevelopEducational } from '@headlessly/collaborate-teaching-professionals-develop-educational'

const edu = collaborateTeachingProfessionalsDevelopEducational()

// Initiate a collaborative program for AP Biology
const collab = await edu.initiateCollaboration({
  subject: 'AP Biology',
  gradeLevel: '11-12',
  participants: ['Dr. Martinez', 'Ms. Chen', 'Mr. Okafor'],
  objective: 'Redesign lab-based curriculum for Next Generation Science Standards'
})

// Draft the curriculum
await edu.draftCurriculum({
  collaborationId: collab.id,
  units: [
    { title: 'Molecular Biology', weeks: 4, labs: 3 },
    { title: 'Ecology and Evolution', weeks: 5, labs: 4 },
    { title: 'Human Systems', weeks: 3, labs: 2 }
  ]
})

// Submit for peer review
await edu.conductPeerReview({
  collaborationId: collab.id,
  reviewers: ['Dr. Patel', 'Ms. Thompson'],
  deadline: '2026-03-15'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify lead teacher when peer review is complete
edu.peerReviewCompleted(async ({ collaborationId, reviewerId, verdict }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'lead-teacher',
    message: `Peer review submitted by ${reviewerId}: ${verdict}`
  })
})

// Schedule full rollout after successful pilot
edu.pilotCompleted(async ({ programId, successRate }) => {
  if (successRate >= 0.80) {
    await edu.finalizeProgram({ programId })
  }
})
```
