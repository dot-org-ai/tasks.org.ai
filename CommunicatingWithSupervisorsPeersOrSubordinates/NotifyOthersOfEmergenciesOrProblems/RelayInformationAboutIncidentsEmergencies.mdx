## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { relayInformationAboutIncidentsEmergencies } from '@headlessly/relay-information-about-incidents-emergencies'

const comms = relayInformationAboutIncidentsEmergencies()

// Receive an incident report
const incident = await comms.receiveIncidentReport({
  type: 'structure fire',
  location: '1200 Main Street, Building C',
  reportedBy: 'Security Officer Ramirez',
  severity: 'high',
  description: 'Smoke visible from third floor, east wing. Fire alarm activated.'
})

// Broadcast alert to response teams
await comms.broadcastAlert({
  incidentId: incident.id,
  channels: ['radio-frequency-3', 'sms-group-fire', 'command-center-phone'],
  message: 'Structure fire at 1200 Main St, Bldg C, 3rd floor east wing. All units respond.',
  priority: 'emergency'
})

// Update the situation as it develops
await comms.updateSituation({
  incidentId: incident.id,
  update: 'Fire contained to east wing. Evacuation of floors 2-4 complete. No injuries reported.'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Escalate when receipts are not confirmed within 5 minutes
comms.alertBroadcasted(async ({ incidentId, recipients }) => {
  await scheduleTask({
    action: 'confirmReceipt',
    incidentId,
    delay: '5m',
    escalateUnconfirmed: true
  })
})

// Auto-log all communications when incident is resolved
comms.situationUpdated(async ({ incidentId, status }) => {
  if (status === 'resolved') {
    await comms.logCommunication({ incidentId })
  }
})
```
