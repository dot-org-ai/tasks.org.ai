# Report Vehicle Equipment Malfunctions

> Business-as-Code definition for reporting vehicle or equipment malfunctions. Models the detection, documentation, and communication of mechanical failures to fleet management and repair teams.

## Overview

Reporting vehicle or equipment malfunctions involves detecting mechanical failures, safety defects, or performance degradation in vehicles and mobile equipment, then documenting and communicating these issues to fleet managers, mechanics, and dispatch personnel. This definition covers pre-trip inspections, in-service failure reporting, out-of-service tagging, and repair tracking for fleets, heavy equipment, and industrial vehicles.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { reportVehicleEquipmentMalfunctions } from '@headlessly/report-vehicle-equipment-malfunctions'

const fleet = reportVehicleEquipmentMalfunctions()

// Report a brake system malfunction
const report = await fleet.reportMalfunction({
  vehicle: 'TRK-2847',
  type: 'Brake System',
  description: 'Soft brake pedal, increased stopping distance noted during route',
  severity: 'critical',
  reportedBy: 'Driver Johnson',
  location: 'Route 95, Mile Marker 42'
})

// Tag the vehicle out of service
await fleet.tagOutOfService({
  reportId: report.id,
  vehicle: 'TRK-2847',
  reason: 'Brake system failure - unsafe for operation'
})

// Create repair order
await fleet.createRepairOrder({
  reportId: report.id,
  assignedTo: 'Main Garage',
  priority: 'urgent'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Reassign routes when a vehicle goes out of service
fleet.vehicleTaggedOutOfService(async ({ vehicle, reportId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'dispatch',
    message: `Vehicle ${vehicle} is out of service. Reassign active routes immediately.`
  })
})

// Notify fleet supervisor when repair is completed
fleet.repairCompleted(async ({ vehicle, repairOrderId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'fleet-supervisor',
    message: `Vehicle ${vehicle} repair complete (Order #${repairOrderId}). Ready for return-to-service inspection.`
  })
})
```
