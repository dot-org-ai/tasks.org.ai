## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { warnIndividualsAboutRuleViolations } from '@headlessly/warn-individuals-about-rule-violations'

const warnings = warnIndividualsAboutRuleViolations()

// Identify a safety violation
const violation = await warnings.identifyViolation({
  individual: 'EMP-4521',
  rule: 'PPE-003: Required hard hat in construction zones',
  location: 'Site B, Sector 4',
  description: 'Employee observed in active construction zone without hard hat',
  severity: 'high'
})

// Issue a verbal warning
await warnings.issueVerbalWarning({
  violationId: violation.id,
  issuedBy: 'Safety Supervisor Martinez',
  notes: 'Employee reminded of mandatory PPE policy and provided replacement hard hat'
})

// Assign corrective action
await warnings.assignCorrectiveAction({
  violationId: violation.id,
  action: 'Complete PPE safety refresher training within 48 hours',
  deadline: '2026-02-07'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Escalate on third violation within 90 days
warnings.violationIdentified(async ({ individual, rule }) => {
  const history = await warnings.getWarningHistory({
    individual,
    rule,
    withinDays: 90
  })
  if (history.length >= 2) {
    await warnings.escalateViolation({ individual, rule, reason: 'Third violation in 90 days' })
  }
})

// Notify HR when written warning is issued
warnings.writtenWarningIssued(async ({ individual, violationId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'hr-department',
    message: `Written warning issued to ${individual} for violation #${violationId}`
  })
})
```
