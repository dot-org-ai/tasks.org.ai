## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { requestEmergencyPersonnel } from '@headlessly/request-emergency-personnel'

const emergency = requestEmergencyPersonnel()

// Assess a workplace emergency
const assessment = await emergency.assessEmergency({
  type: 'chemical spill',
  location: 'Warehouse B, Loading Dock 4',
  severity: 'high',
  injuries: 2,
  description: 'Forklift punctured chemical drum. Two workers exposed to fumes.'
})

// Specify required resources
await emergency.specifyResources({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  resources: [
    { type: 'hazmat', units: 1 },
    { type: 'ems', units: 2, reason: 'Chemical exposure treatment' },
    { type: 'fire', units: 1, reason: 'Ventilation and containment support' }
  ]
})

// Submit the request
await emergency.submitRequest({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  contactOnScene: 'Safety Officer Chen, ext. 4401',
  accessInstructions: 'Enter via Gate 3, proceed to Warehouse B south entrance'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert facility manager when personnel are dispatched
emergency.personnelDispatched(async ({ incidentId, units }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'facility-manager',
    message: `Emergency units dispatched to incident #${incidentId}: ${units.map(u => u.type).join(', ')}. Ensure access routes are clear.`
  })
})

// Auto-generate incident report after all units arrive
emergency.arrivalConfirmed(async ({ incidentId }) => {
  const allUnits = await emergency.findRequests({ incidentId })
  const allArrived = allUnits.every(u => u.status === 'on-scene')
  if (allArrived) {
    await emergency.documentResponse({ incidentId })
  }
})
```
