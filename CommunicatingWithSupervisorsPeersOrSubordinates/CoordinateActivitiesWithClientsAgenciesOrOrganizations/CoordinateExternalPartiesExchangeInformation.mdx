## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { coordinateExternalPartiesExchangeInformation } from '@headlessly/coordinate-external-parties-exchange-information'

const exchange = coordinateExternalPartiesExchangeInformation()

// Request information from business partner
const request = await exchange.requestInformation({
  party: 'partner-org-123',
  type: 'inventory_availability',
  urgency: 'routine',
  format: 'JSON',
  deliveryBy: '2026-02-28'
})

// Establish secure exchange protocol
await exchange.establishProtocol({
  requestId: request.id,
  method: 'SFTP',
  encryption: 'AES-256',
  authentication: 'SSH-key',
  schedule: 'daily at 02:00 UTC'
})

// Package and transfer data to client
const dataPackage = await exchange.packageData({
  type: 'project_status',
  recipient: 'client-org-456',
  contents: [
    { file: 'milestone_report.pdf', size: 2048000 },
    { file: 'budget_summary.xlsx', size: 512000 }
  ],
  metadata: {
    projectId: 'proj-789',
    reportingPeriod: 'Q1 2026'
  }
})

await exchange.transferInformation({
  packageId: dataPackage.id,
  recipient: 'client-org-456'
})

// Confirm receipt and audit
await exchange.confirmReceipt({
  packageId: dataPackage.id,
  confirmedBy: 'client-contact@example.com.ai',
  timestamp: '2026-02-25T10:30:00Z'
})

await exchange.auditExchange({
  packageId: dataPackage.id,
  complianceFramework: 'SOC2'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-retry failed transfers
exchange.informationTransferred(async ({ packageId, status }) => {
  if (status === 'failed') {
    await wait({ minutes: 30 })
    const retryCount = await getRetryCount({ packageId })
    if (retryCount < 3) {
      await exchange.transferInformation({ packageId })
    } else {
      await alert({
        to: 'data-exchange-manager',
        message: `Transfer failed after 3 attempts: ${packageId}`
      })
    }
  }
})

// Track unconfirmed receipts
exchange.informationTransferred(async ({ packageId, recipient }) => {
  await wait({ hours: 24 })
  const confirmation = await exchange.getExchanges({ packageId })
  if (!confirmation.confirmed) {
    await notify({
      to: 'data-exchange-manager',
      message: `No receipt confirmation from ${recipient} for ${packageId}`
    })
  }
})
```
