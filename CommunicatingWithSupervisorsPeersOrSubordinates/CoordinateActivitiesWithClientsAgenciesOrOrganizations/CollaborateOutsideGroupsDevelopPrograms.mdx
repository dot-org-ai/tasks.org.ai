### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-schedule partnership review meetings
collaboration.partnershipEstablished(async ({ partnershipId, formalAgreement }) => {
  const meetingFrequency = formalAgreement.governanceStructure.includes('monthly') ? 30 : 90

  await scheduleRecurringMeeting({
    partnershipId,
    meetingType: 'steering-committee',
    frequency: `Every ${meetingFrequency} days`,
    participants: ['organization-leadership', 'partner-leadership'],
    agenda: ['Progress review', 'Issue resolution', 'Planning']
  })
})

// Track partnership outcome metrics
collaboration.programExecutionCoordinated(async ({ programPlanId, activitiesCompleted }) => {
  await trackPartnershipMetrics({
    programPlanId,
    completedActivities: activitiesCompleted.length,
    timestamp: new Date()
  })
})

// Alert when shared objectives are at risk
collaboration.partnershipOutcomesEvaluated(async ({ objectives, actualResults }) => {
  const atRiskObjectives = objectives.filter(obj => {
    const actual = actualResults.find(r => r.objectiveId === obj.id)
    return actual && (actual.progress / obj.target) < 0.7 // Less than 70% of target
  })

  if (atRiskObjectives.length > 0) {
    await notifyPartnershipTeam({
      priority: 'high',
      message: `${atRiskObjectives.length} partnership objectives at risk`,
      requestActionPlan: true
    })
  }
})
```
