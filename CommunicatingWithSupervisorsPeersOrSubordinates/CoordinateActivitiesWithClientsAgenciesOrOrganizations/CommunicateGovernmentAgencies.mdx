## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { communicateGovernmentAgencies } from '@headlessly/communicate-government-agencies'

const govComm = communicateGovernmentAgencies()

// Submit quarterly compliance report
const report = await govComm.submitComplianceReport({
  agencyId: 'EPA-Region5',
  reportType: 'air-emissions-quarterly',
  reportingPeriod: 'Q4-2025',
  submittedBy: 'compliance-officer-123',
  reportData: {
    facilityId: 'facility-XYZ',
    totalEmissions: {
      NOx: { value: 12.4, unit: 'tons' },
      SO2: { value: 5.2, unit: 'tons' },
      VOC: { value: 3.1, unit: 'tons' }
    },
    monitoringData: 'continuous-emissions-monitoring.csv',
    certificationStatement: 'I certify that this report is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge'
  },
  deadline: '2026-01-30'
})

// Respond to agency information request
await govComm.respondToInformationRequest({
  requestId: 'OSHA-IR-2026-0042',
  agencyId: 'OSHA-District7',
  requestDate: '2026-02-01',
  requestedInformation: 'Employee injury and illness records for 2025',

})

// Apply for operational permit
const permit = await govComm.applyForPermit({
  agencyId: 'state-environmental-agency',
  permitType: 'air-quality-operating-permit',
  facilityId: 'facility-XYZ',
  applicationData: {
    operationType: 'manufacturing',
    emissionSources: ['natural-gas-boiler', 'coating-oven', 'emergency-generator'],
    requestedCapacity: 'Existing operations, no expansion',
    controlTechnologies: ['SCR on boiler', 'Thermal oxidizer on oven']
  },
  supportingDocuments: [
    'emissions-calculations.pdf',

  ],
  applicationFee: 5000
})

// Track submission deadlines
await govComm.trackSubmissionDeadline({

    { daysBefore: 14, notify: 'cfo' },
    { daysBefore: 7, notify: 'accounting-manager' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-escalate when deadlines are approaching
govComm.submissionDeadlineTracked(async ({ deadline, submissionType, agencyId }) => {
  const daysUntilDeadline = (new Date(deadline) - new Date()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)

  if (daysUntilDeadline <= 7 && !await isSubmissionPrepared(submissionType)) {
    await govComm.escalateRegulatoryIssue({
      issue: `${submissionType} due in ${Math.floor(daysUntilDeadline)} days - not yet prepared`,
      agency: agencyId,
      severity: 'high',
      escalateTo: 'compliance-director'
    })
  }
})

// Notify legal when information requests are received
govComm.informationRequestResponded(async ({ requestId, agencyId, requestedInformation }) => {
  if (agencyId.includes('OSHA') || agencyId.includes('EPA') || requestedInformation.includes('violation')) {
    await notifyLegalDepartment({
      requestId,
      agency: agencyId,
      scope: requestedInformation,
      recommendReview: true
    })
  }
})
```
