### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-track specification acknowledgments
techComm.specificationTransmitted(async ({ transmittalId, recipientId, responseDeadline }) => {
  // Set reminder for 3 days before deadline
  const reminderDate = new Date(responseDeadline)
  reminderDate.setDate(reminderDate.getDate() - 3)

  setTimeout(async () => {
    const status = await getTransmittalStatus(transmittalId)
    if (!status.acknowledged) {
      await sendReminder({
        to: recipientId,
        subject: `Reminder: Technical Specifications Response Due in 3 Days`,
        transmittalId
      })
    }
  }, reminderDate - new Date())
})

// Notify quality team when compliance submissions are made
techComm.complianceDataSubmitted(async ({ agencyId, submissionType, complianceDocuments }) => {
  await notifyQualityAssurance({
    message: `Compliance submission to ${agencyId}: ${submissionType}`,
    documentCount: complianceDocuments.length,
    reviewRequired: true
  })
})

// Alert project team when technical revisions are issued
techComm.technicalRevisionIssued(async ({ revisionNumber, changesDescription, affectedSpecifications }) => {
  await notifyProjectTeam({
    priority: 'high',
    message: `Technical Revision ${revisionNumber} issued affecting ${affectedSpecifications.join(', ')}`,
    changes: changesDescription,
    actionRequired: 'Review and acknowledge receipt within 48 hours'
  })
})
```
