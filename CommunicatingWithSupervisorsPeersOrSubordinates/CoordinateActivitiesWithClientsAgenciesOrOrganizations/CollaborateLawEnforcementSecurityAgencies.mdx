### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-escalate critical security incidents to management and agencies
agencyCollab.securityIncidentReported(async ({ incidentType, urgency, estimatedImpact }) => {
  if (urgency === 'critical' || incidentType === 'ransomware' || incidentType === 'data-breach') {
    await escalateToExecutives({
      incident: incidentType,
      urgency,
      impact: estimatedImpact,
      notifyBoard: true
    })

    // Automatically notify federal agencies for certain incident types
    if (incidentType === 'ransomware' || estimatedImpact.recordsCompromised > 10000) {
      await agencyCollab.shareIntelligence({
        agencyId: 'fbi-cyber-division',
        intelligenceType: 'incident-notification',
        urgency: 'immediate'
      })
    }
  }
})

// Track agency request response times
agencyCollab.agencyRequestResponded(async ({ requestId, agencyId, respondedDate, requestType }) => {
  await trackMetric({
    metric: 'agency-request-response-time',
    agency: agencyId,
    requestType,
    completionDate: respondedDate
  })
})

// Distribute threat intelligence internally
agencyCollab.threatBriefingReceived(async ({ threatInformation, agencyId }) => {
  await distributeInternally({
    recipients: ['it-security-team', 'operations-team', 'risk-management'],
    subject: `Threat Advisory from ${agencyId}`,
    content: threatInformation,
    actionRequired: 'Review recommendations and implement within 48 hours'
  })
})
```
