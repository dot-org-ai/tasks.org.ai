## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { communicateManagementStaffResolveProblems } from '@headlessly/communicate-management-staff-resolve-problems'

const communication = communicateManagementStaffResolveProblems()

// Report a problem to management
const problem = await communication.reportProblem({
  title: 'Production line 3 downtime exceeds SLA',
  department: 'Manufacturing',
  severity: 'high',
  impact: 'Daily output reduced by 40%, affecting Q1 delivery commitments',
  reportedBy: 'shift-supervisor'
})

// Escalate if not resolved within SLA
await communication.escalateIssue({
  problemId: problem.id,
  escalateTo: 'vp-operations',
  reason: 'No response after 4 hours, customer deliveries at risk'
})

// Request resources for resolution
await communication.requestResources({
  problemId: problem.id,
  resourceType: 'emergency-maintenance',
  estimatedCost: 15000,
  justification: 'Third-party technician required for hydraulic system repair'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-escalate high-severity problems after timeout
communication.problemReported(async ({ problem }) => {
  if (problem.severity === 'high') {
    setTimeout(async () => {
      const status = await communication.findProblems({ id: problem.id })
      if (status.resolution === null) {
        await communication.escalateIssue({
          problemId: problem.id,
          escalateTo: 'department-head',
          reason: 'Auto-escalation: 4-hour SLA exceeded'
        })
      }
    }, 4 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
  }
})

// Notify stakeholders on resource approval
communication.resourcesRequested(async ({ request }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'finance-team',
    message: `Resource request pending approval: ${request.resourceType} - $${request.estimatedCost}`
  })
})
```
