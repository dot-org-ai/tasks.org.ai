# Collaborate Others Determine Technical Details

> Business-as-Code definition for collaborating with others to determine technical details of productions. Models the coordination between technical, creative, and operational teams to resolve technical requirements for media, manufacturing, and event productions.

## Overview

Collaborating to determine technical details of productions involves working with directors, engineers, technical crews, and venue managers to define the lighting, sound, staging, equipment, and infrastructure requirements for a production. This applies to film and television production, live events, theatrical performances, and broadcast operations where technical precision is essential for successful execution. The process includes technical walkthroughs, equipment specification meetings, and coordination of technical rehearsals to validate all details before the production goes live.

| Director | The creative lead who defines the artistic vision that technical details must support |
| TechnicalCrew | Specialists in lighting, sound, rigging, and staging who implement technical requirements |
| VenueManager | The facility operator responsible for space, power, and infrastructure constraints |
| EquipmentProvider | Rental or supply company providing specialized production equipment |
| BroadcastEngineer | Technical professional managing signal routing, transmission, and recording systems |
| SafetyInspector | Authority who evaluates technical setups for safety compliance |

## Roles

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { collaborateOthersDetermineTechnicalDetails } from '@headlessly/collaborate-others-determine-technical-details'

const tech = collaborateOthersDetermineTechnicalDetails()

// Define technical requirements for a live broadcast event
const requirements = await tech.defineTechnicalRequirements({
  production: 'annual-awards-ceremony-2026',
  venue: 'civic-center-main-hall',
  departments: ['lighting', 'sound', 'video', 'staging'],
  broadcastFormat: '4K-HDR'
})

// Create venue plot with equipment placements
const plot = await tech.createVenuePlot({
  productionId: requirements.productionId,
  elements: [
    { type: 'lighting-rig', position: 'overhead-grid-A', fixtures: 48 },
    { type: 'speaker-array', position: 'stage-left', units: 12 },
    { type: 'camera-position', position: 'front-of-house', cameras: 4 }
  ]
})

// Schedule a technical rehearsal
await tech.scheduleTechnicalRehearsal({
  productionId: requirements.productionId,
  date: '2026-03-10',
  duration: '8 hours',
  departments: ['all']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify equipment provider when needs are confirmed
tech.equipmentNeedsReviewed(async ({ productionId, equipmentList }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'equipment-provider',
    message: `Equipment order confirmed for production ${productionId}`,
    data: equipmentList
  })
})

// Auto-generate safety review after venue plot is finalized
tech.venuePlotCreated(async ({ productionId, venuePlotId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'safety-inspector',
    message: `Venue plot ready for safety review: production ${productionId}`,
    attachments: [venuePlotId]
  })
})
```
