# Discuss Production Content Progress Others

> Business-as-Code definition for discussing production content and progress with others. Models the communication process for reviewing creative and production output, tracking progress against schedules, and aligning teams on content direction and delivery timelines.

## Overview

Discussing production content and progress with others involves holding regular check-ins, reviews, and status meetings where creative teams, producers, editors, and stakeholders evaluate the quality and completeness of production output. This applies to media production, publishing, advertising, software development, and manufacturing contexts where content or deliverables progress through defined stages. These discussions surface quality issues, identify schedule risks, and ensure that the evolving work product aligns with the original vision and client expectations.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { discussProductionContentProgressOthers } from '@headlessly/discuss-production-content-progress-others'

const production = discussProductionContentProgressOthers()

// Report weekly production progress
const report = await production.reportProgress({
  production: 'brand-campaign-spring-2026',
  period: 'week-of-2026-02-03',
  completed: ['hero-video-rough-cut', 'social-media-copy-batch-1'],
  inProgress: ['landing-page-design', 'email-sequence-draft'],
  blocked: []
})

// Review a content draft
const review = await production.reviewContentDraft({
  production: 'brand-campaign-spring-2026',
  draft: 'hero-video-rough-cut',
  reviewers: ['creative-director', 'client-rep'],
  criteria: ['brand-alignment', 'messaging-clarity', 'visual-quality']
})

// Provide review notes to the content creator
await production.provideReviewNotes({
  draftId: review.draftId,
  notes: [
    { timestamp: '00:15', note: 'Tighten the opening transition' },
    { timestamp: '01:42', note: 'Replace stock footage with branded b-roll' },
    { area: 'audio', note: 'Music bed overpowers voiceover in final segment' }

```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify client when deliverable is approved
production.deliverableApproved(async ({ production: prodId, deliverable, approvedBy }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'client-rep',
    message: `Deliverable "${deliverable}" approved for ${prodId} by ${approvedBy}`
  })
})

// Alert production manager on schedule delays
production.delayEscalated(async ({ production: prodId, milestone, delayDays }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'production-manager',
    message: `Schedule delay on ${prodId}: "${milestone}" delayed by ${delayDays} days`,
    priority: delayDays > 5 ? 'urgent' : 'normal'
  })
})
```
