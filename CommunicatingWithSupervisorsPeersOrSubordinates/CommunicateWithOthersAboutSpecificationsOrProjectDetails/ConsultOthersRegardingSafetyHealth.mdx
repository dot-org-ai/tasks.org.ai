# Consult Others Regarding Safety Health

> Business-as-Code definition for consulting with others regarding safety or health equipment or facilities. Models the advisory process where safety professionals, facility managers, and health officers collaborate to evaluate and improve workplace safety systems and infrastructure.

## Overview

Consulting with others regarding safety or health equipment or facilities involves engaging safety officers, occupational health professionals, facility managers, and regulatory inspectors in discussions about the adequacy, placement, maintenance, and compliance of safety systems and health-related infrastructure. This includes evaluating personal protective equipment needs, assessing emergency systems such as fire suppression and ventilation, reviewing facility layouts for ergonomic and safety compliance, and planning upgrades to meet evolving regulatory standards. The consultations ensure that workplaces maintain safe operating conditions and meet all applicable health and safety requirements.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { consultOthersRegardingSafetyHealth } from '@headlessly/consult-others-regarding-safety-health'

const safety = consultOthersRegardingSafetyHealth()

// Conduct a hazard assessment for a manufacturing floor
const assessment = await safety.conductHazardAssessment({
  facility: 'plant-north-building-a',
  area: 'welding-bay-3',
  assessors: ['safety-officer', 'occupational-health-specialist'],
  hazardTypes: ['chemical-exposure', 'fire', 'noise', 'ergonomic']
})

// Review equipment compliance
await safety.reviewEquipmentCompliance({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  equipment: [
    { type: 'fume-extraction-system', serialNumber: 'FES-2024-047' },
    { type: 'fire-suppression', serialNumber: 'FS-2023-112' },
    { type: 'emergency-eyewash', serialNumber: 'EW-2025-003' }
  ],
  standards: ['OSHA-29-CFR-1910', 'NFPA-10']
})

// Recommend corrective actions for identified deficiencies
await safety.recommendCorrectiveAction({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  actions: [
    { deficiency: 'Inadequate ventilation in welding bay', remedy: 'Install additional fume extraction hood', priority: 'high', dueDate: '2026-03-01' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-schedule follow-up inspection after corrective action is approved
safety.correctiveActionApproved(async ({ assessmentId, actionId, dueDate }) => {
  await safety.scheduleFacilityInspection({
    facility: assessmentId,
    purpose: `Verify corrective action ${actionId}`,
    scheduledDate: dueDate,
    inspectors: ['safety-officer']
  })
})

// Notify employees when PPE requirements change
safety.ppeRequirementsUpdated(async ({ area, updatedRequirements }) => {
  await notify({
    to: `employees-${area}`,
    message: `PPE requirements updated for ${area}. Please review new specifications.`,
    data: updatedRequirements
  })
})
```
