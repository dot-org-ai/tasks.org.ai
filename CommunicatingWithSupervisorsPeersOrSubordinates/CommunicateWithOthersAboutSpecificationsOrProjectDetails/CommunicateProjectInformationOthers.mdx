# Communicate Project Information Others

> Business-as-Code definition for communicating project information to others. Models the structured dissemination of project status, milestones, risks, and deliverables to stakeholders across the organization.

## Overview

Communicating project information to others involves preparing and delivering updates on project scope, timeline, budget, risks, and deliverables to diverse audiences including team members, management, clients, and cross-functional partners. This includes status reports, milestone presentations, risk briefings, and change notifications that keep all parties informed and aligned. Effective project communication prevents misalignment, enables timely decision-making, and ensures that dependencies and blockers are surfaced before they impact delivery.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { communicateProjectInformationOthers } from '@headlessly/communicate-project-information-others'

const comms = communicateProjectInformationOthers()

// Publish a weekly status report
const report = await comms.publishStatusReport({
  project: 'platform-migration-v3',
  period: 'week-of-2026-02-03',
  summary: 'Database migration 85% complete. On track for Feb 28 go-live.',
  risks: [{ id: 'risk-007', status: 'mitigated' }],
  nextSteps: ['Complete data validation', 'Schedule UAT with client']
})

// Escalate a newly identified risk
await comms.escalateRisk({
  project: 'platform-migration-v3',
  risk: {
    description: 'Third-party API deprecation may affect integration timeline',
    likelihood: 'high',
    impact: 'medium',
    mitigation: 'Evaluate alternative endpoints by Feb 15'
  },
  escalateTo: ['project-sponsor', 'technical-lead']
})

// Present a milestone to stakeholders
await comms.presentMilestone({
  project: 'platform-migration-v3',
  milestone: 'data-migration-complete',
  audience: ['client-stakeholder', 'governance-board'],
  scheduledDate: '2026-02-28'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-schedule review when milestone is delivered
comms.milestonePresented(async ({ project, milestone }) => {
  await comms.scheduleReview({
    project,
    topic: `Post-milestone review: ${milestone}`,
    participants: ['project-team', 'client-stakeholder'],
    withinDays: 5
  })
})

// Notify governance board on risk escalation
comms.riskEscalated(async ({ project, risk, escalatedBy }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'governance-board',
    message: `Risk escalated on ${project}: ${risk.description}`,
    priority: risk.likelihood === 'high' ? 'urgent' : 'normal'
  })
})
```
