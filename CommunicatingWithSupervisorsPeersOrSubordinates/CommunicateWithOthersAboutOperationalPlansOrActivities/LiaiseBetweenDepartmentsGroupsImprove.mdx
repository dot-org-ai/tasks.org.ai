## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { liaiseBetweenDepartmentsGroupsImprove } from '@headlessly/liaise-between-departments-groups-improve'

const liaison = liaiseBetweenDepartmentsGroupsImprove()

// Identify a communication gap between teams
const gap = await liaison.identifyGap({
  departments: ['Engineering', 'Product Management'],
  description: 'No formal handoff process for feature requirements',
  impact: 'Frequent rework due to misunderstood specifications'
})

// Establish a new communication channel
await liaison.establishChannel({
  gapId: gap.id,
  type: 'shared-workspace',
  name: 'Engineering-Product Requirements Channel',
  participants: ['engineering-leads', 'product-managers']
})

// Schedule recurring sync meetings
await liaison.scheduleSyncMeeting({
  departments: ['Engineering', 'Product Management'],
  frequency: 'weekly',
  day: 'Tuesday',
  time: '10:00',
  agenda: ['Requirements review', 'Blocker triage', 'Sprint alignment']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert leadership when blockers are escalated
liaison.blockerEscalated(async ({ initiative, departments, description }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'executive-sponsor',
    message: `Cross-functional blocker between ${departments.join(' and ')}: ${description}`
  })
})

// Auto-generate progress reports after action items are completed
liaison.actionItemCompleted(async ({ initiativeId, completedItems, totalItems }) => {
  const percentComplete = Math.round((completedItems / totalItems) * 100)
  if (percentComplete % 25 === 0) {
    await liaison.reportProgress({
      initiativeId,
      summary: `${percentComplete}% of action items completed`
    })
  }
})
```
