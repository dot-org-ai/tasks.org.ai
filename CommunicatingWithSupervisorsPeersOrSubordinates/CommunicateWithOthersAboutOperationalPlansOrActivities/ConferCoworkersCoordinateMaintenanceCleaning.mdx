## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { conferCoworkersCoordinateMaintenanceCleaning } from '@headlessly/confer-coworkers-coordinate-maintenance-cleaning'

const maintenance = conferCoworkersCoordinateMaintenanceCleaning()

// Create a new maintenance work order
const workOrder = await maintenance.createWorkOrder({
  zone: 'Building A - 3rd Floor',
  type: 'preventive',
  description: 'HVAC filter replacement and duct cleaning',
  priority: 'medium',
  requestedBy: 'facility-occupant-042'
})

// Assign the task to the morning shift technician
await maintenance.assignTask({
  workOrderId: workOrder.id,
  assignee: 'tech-james-wilson',
  shift: 'morning',
  scheduledDate: '2026-02-10'
})

// Log task completion after work is done
await maintenance.logCompletion({
  workOrderId: workOrder.id,
  completedBy: 'tech-james-wilson',
  notes: 'Filters replaced, ducts cleaned and inspected',
  qualityCheck: 'passed'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify supervisor when issues are escalated
maintenance.issueEscalated(async ({ workOrderId, zone, reason }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'maintenance-supervisor',
    message: `Escalated issue in ${zone}: ${reason}`
  })
})

// Auto-reorder supplies when tasks deplete inventory
maintenance.taskCompleted(async ({ workOrderId, suppliesUsed }) => {
  for (const supply of suppliesUsed) {
    const levels = await maintenance.getSupplyLevels({ item: supply.id })
    if (levels.quantity < levels.reorderThreshold) {
      await maintenance.requestSupplies({ items: [supply.id], quantity: supply.reorderAmount })
    }
  }
})
```
