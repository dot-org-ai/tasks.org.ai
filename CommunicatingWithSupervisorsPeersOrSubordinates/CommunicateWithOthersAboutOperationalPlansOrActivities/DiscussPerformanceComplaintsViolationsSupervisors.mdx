## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { discussPerformanceComplaintsViolationsSupervisors } from '@headlessly/discuss-performance-complaints-violations-supervisors'

const supervisor = discussPerformanceComplaintsViolationsSupervisors()

// Report a performance issue to supervisor
const issue = await supervisor.raisePerformanceIssue({
  employeeId: 'emp-12345',
  supervisorId: 'sup-67890',
  issueType: 'quality',
  description: 'Recurring errors in data entry affecting downstream processes',
  severity: 'moderate'
})

// Document a policy violation
await supervisor.documentViolation({
  employeeId: 'emp-12345',
  policyCode: 'SAFETY-101',
  violationDate: '2026-02-04',
  description: 'Failed to wear required PPE in manufacturing area',
  witnesses: ['emp-22222', 'emp-33333']
})

// Schedule discussion with supervisor
const meeting = await supervisor.scheduleDiscussion({
  issueId: issue.id,
  supervisorId: 'sup-67890',
  scheduledFor: '2026-02-07T14:00:00Z',
  agenda: 'Review data entry quality issues and develop improvement plan'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify HR when policy violation is documented
supervisor.violationDocumented(async ({ violation, employeeId }) => {
  if (violation.severity === 'critical') {
    await notifyHR({
      subject: `Critical Policy Violation: ${violation.policyCode}`,
      employeeId,
      details: violation
    })
  }
})

// Auto-escalate unresolved issues after threshold period
supervisor.resolutionTracked(async ({ issueId, daysSinceReported }) => {
  if (daysSinceReported > 14 && status === 'unresolved') {
    await supervisor.escalateToManagement({
      issueId,
      reason: 'Unresolved after 14 days',
      escalateTo: 'department-manager'
    })
  }
})
```
