## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { conferManagersMakeOperationalDecisions } from '@headlessly/confer-managers-make-operational-decisions'

const decisions = conferManagersMakeOperationalDecisions()

// Submit a decision request for management review
const request = await decisions.submitDecisionRequest({
  title: 'Shift schedule restructuring for Q2 production ramp',
  department: 'Manufacturing',
  urgency: 'high',
  description: 'Production targets increased 30% for Q2, requiring shift changes',
  submittedBy: 'supervisor-garcia'
})

// Prepare the option analysis
await decisions.prepareAnalysis({
  requestId: request.id,
  options: [
    { name: 'Add third shift', cost: 180000, riskLevel: 'medium', leadTime: '3 weeks' },
    { name: 'Extend existing shifts by 2 hours', cost: 95000, riskLevel: 'low', leadTime: '1 week' },
    { name: 'Hire temporary workforce', cost: 150000, riskLevel: 'high', leadTime: '2 weeks' }
  ],
  recommendation: 'Extend existing shifts by 2 hours',
  rationale: 'Lowest cost and fastest implementation with manageable overtime impact'
})

// Record the decision after management consultation
await decisions.recordDecision({
  requestId: request.id,
  chosenOption: 'Extend existing shifts by 2 hours',
  approvedBy: 'manager-thompson',
  rationale: 'Minimizes disruption while meeting Q2 targets',
  effectiveDate: '2026-03-01'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify stakeholders when decisions are recorded
decisions.decisionRecorded(async ({ requestId, title, chosenOption, approvedBy }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'department-all',
    message: `Decision on "${title}": ${chosenOption} (approved by ${approvedBy})`
  })
})

// Auto-schedule outcome review 30 days after implementation
decisions.decisionImplemented(async ({ requestId, effectiveDate }) => {
  const reviewDate = addDays(new Date(effectiveDate), 30)
  await decisions.reviewOutcome({
    requestId,
    scheduledDate: reviewDate.toISOString(),
    reviewType: '30-day-assessment'
  })
})
```
