## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { discussProblemsIssuesSupervisors } from '@headlessly/discuss-problems-issues-supervisors'

const issues = discussProblemsIssuesSupervisors()

// Report an operational problem to supervisor
const problem = await issues.reportProblem({
  employeeId: 'emp-12345',
  supervisorId: 'sup-67890',
  category: 'equipment',
  title: 'Production line conveyor belt malfunction',
  description: 'Belt slips intermittently causing 15-minute delays per shift',
  severity: 'high',
  impactedOperations: ['assembly-line-3']
})

// Request supervisory support
await issues.requestSupport({
  problemId: problem.id,
  supportType: 'resources',
  requestedResources: ['maintenance-technician', 'replacement-parts'],
  urgency: 'immediate'
})

// Propose a solution
await issues.proposeSolution({
  problemId: problem.id,
  proposedBy: 'emp-12345',
  solution: 'Replace worn belt tensioner and realign pulley system',
  estimatedCost: 850,
  estimatedDowntime: '4 hours'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-escalate high-severity problems not resolved within threshold
issues.problemReported(async ({ problemId, severity, reportedAt }) => {
  if (severity === 'critical') {
    setTimeout(async () => {
      const status = await issues.getProblemStatus(problemId)
      if (status !== 'resolved') {
        await issues.escalateIssue({
          problemId,
          reason: 'Critical issue unresolved after 2 hours',
          escalateTo: 'operations-director'
        })
      }
    }, 2 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // 2 hours
  }
})

// Notify relevant teams when support is requested
issues.supportRequested(async ({ problemId, supportType, requestedResources }) => {
  if (supportType === 'resources' && requestedResources.includes('maintenance-technician')) {
    await notifyTeam({
      team: 'facilities-maintenance',
      subject: `Maintenance Support Requested - Problem ${problemId}`,
      priority: 'high'
    })
  }
})
```
