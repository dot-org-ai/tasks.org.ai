# Confer Others Conduct Arrange Operational

> Business-as-Code definition for conferring with others to conduct or arrange operational activities. Models the collaborative planning and coordination workflows required to organize, schedule, and execute day-to-day operational functions across teams.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { conferOthersConductArrangeOperational } from '@headlessly/confer-others-conduct-arrange-operational'

const operations = conferOthersConductArrangeOperational()

// Draft an operational plan for a corporate relocation
const plan = await operations.draftPlan({
  title: 'Office Relocation - Building C to Building D',
  activities: [
    { name: 'IT infrastructure setup', leadTime: '2 weeks' },
    { name: 'Furniture transport', leadTime: '3 days' },
    { name: 'Employee move-in coordination', leadTime: '1 week' }
  ],
  targetDate: '2026-03-15',
  coordinator: 'ops-coordinator-kim'
})

// Confirm resource commitments
await operations.confirmResources({
  planId: plan.id,
  resources: [
    { type: 'vendor', name: 'IT Systems Inc', service: 'network-setup' },
    { type: 'personnel', count: 8, role: 'moving-crew' },
    { type: 'equipment', items: ['cargo-van-x2', 'dolly-x10'] }
  ]
})

// Schedule the main activity
await operations.scheduleActivity({
  planId: plan.id,
  activity: 'Furniture transport',
  date: '2026-03-14',
  startTime: '07:00',
  venue: 'Building D - Loading Dock',
  assignedLead: 'activity-lead-martinez'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify stakeholders when resources are confirmed
operations.resourcesConfirmed(async ({ planId, title, resources }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'client-stakeholder',
    message: `All resources confirmed for "${title}": ${resources.length} commitments secured`
  })
})

// Auto-schedule review meeting after activity execution
operations.activityExecuted(async ({ planId, activity }) => {
  await operations.conductReview({
    planId,
    activity,
    reviewDate: addDays(new Date(), 3).toISOString(),
    participants: ['operations-coordinator', 'activity-lead', 'client-stakeholder']
  })
})
```
