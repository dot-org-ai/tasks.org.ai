## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { conferOrganizationalMembersAccomplishWork } from '@headlessly/confer-organizational-members-accomplish-work'

const work = conferOrganizationalMembersAccomplishWork()

// Define a new work initiative
const initiative = await work.defineObjective({
  title: 'Annual Regulatory Filing Preparation',
  scope: 'Compile, review, and submit all required regulatory documents for FY2025',
  departments: ['Legal', 'Finance', 'Compliance'],
  deadline: '2026-03-31',
  lead: 'project-lead-chen'
})

// Assign responsibilities to team members
await work.assignResponsibility({
  initiativeId: initiative.id,
  assignments: [
    { member: 'analyst-patel', task: 'Financial data compilation', dueDate: '2026-02-28' },
    { member: 'counsel-rivera', task: 'Legal review and sign-off', dueDate: '2026-03-15' },
    { member: 'officer-nakamura', task: 'Compliance checklist verification', dueDate: '2026-03-20' }

})

// Conduct a check-in meeting
await work.conductCheckIn({
  initiativeId: initiative.id,

  attendees: ['analyst-patel', 'counsel-rivera', 'officer-nakamura'],
  agenda: ['Progress updates', 'Dependency review', 'Risk identification']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify lead when dependencies are blocking progress
work.progressTracked(async ({ initiativeId, blockedTasks }) => {
  if (blockedTasks.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'project-lead',
      message: `${blockedTasks.length} tasks blocked on initiative ${initiativeId}`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-notify stakeholders when deliverables are approved
work.deliverableApproved(async ({ initiativeId, deliverable, approvedBy }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'executive-committee',
    message: `Deliverable "${deliverable}" approved by ${approvedBy} for initiative ${initiativeId}`
  })
})
```
