# Receive Information Instructions Performing Work

> Business-as-Code definition for receiving information or instructions for performing work assignments. Models the inbound communication workflows where workers obtain directives, specifications, and guidance needed to execute their tasks.

## Overview

Receiving information or instructions for performing work assignments involves accepting work directives, technical specifications, procedural guidance, and contextual information from supervisors, clients, or automated systems. This definition captures the instruction receipt lifecycle from initial notification through review, clarification, acknowledgment, and execution readiness. It enables workers to systematically intake, validate, and confirm understanding of work instructions before beginning execution, reducing errors caused by miscommunication or incomplete information.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { receiveInformationInstructionsPerformingWork } from '@headlessly/receive-information-instructions-performing-work'

const instructions = receiveInformationInstructionsPerformingWork()

// Receive a new work instruction
const instruction = await instructions.receiveInstruction({
  title: 'Install electrical conduit on floors 3-5',
  issuedBy: 'supervisor-fernandez',
  assignedTo: 'electrician-park',
  priority: 'high',
  specifications: ['blueprint-elec-3F-5F.pdf', 'conduit-spec-sheet.pdf'],
  deadline: '2026-02-14'
})

// Review the attached specifications
await instructions.reviewSpecification({
  instructionId: instruction.id,
  reviewedBy: 'electrician-park',
  notes: 'Blueprint shows 3/4-inch conduit but spec sheet references 1-inch. Need clarification.'
})

// Request clarification on the discrepancy
await instructions.requestClarification({
  instructionId: instruction.id,
  question: 'Blueprint specifies 3/4-inch conduit but spec sheet says 1-inch. Which is correct for floors 3-5?',
  askedBy: 'electrician-park',
  urgency: 'high'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-acknowledge instructions from automated dispatch
instructions.instructionReceived(async ({ instructionId, source }) => {
  if (source === 'dispatch-system') {
    await instructions.acknowledgeReceipt({
      instructionId,
      acknowledgedBy: 'auto-ack',
      notes: 'Auto-acknowledged from dispatch system'
    })
  }
})

// Alert supervisor when clarifications remain unanswered
instructions.clarificationRequested(async ({ instructionId, question, urgency }) => {
  if (urgency === 'high') {
    await notify({
      to: 'shift-supervisor',
      message: `High-priority clarification needed on instruction ${instructionId}: ${question}`
    })
  }
})
```
