# Communicate Coworkers Coordinate Installations Repairs

> Business-as-Code definition for coordinating installation and repair activities among coworkers. Models the communication lifecycle from job assignment through scheduling, execution coordination, and completion verification.

## Overview

Coordinating installations and repairs requires structured communication between field technicians, dispatchers, and support teams to ensure work is completed safely and on schedule. This definition covers the exchange of technical details, scheduling constraints, material requirements, and status updates across distributed crews working on equipment installations, system upgrades, and corrective repairs.

## Actors

| Dispatcher | Assigns jobs and coordinates crew schedules |
| PartsSupplier | Provides replacement parts and installation materials |
| BuildingManager | Grants site access and communicates facility constraints |
| SafetyInspector | Verifies completed work meets code and safety standards |

## Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| LeadInstaller | Oversees the installation crew and coordinates task sequencing |
| ServiceCoordinator | Manages communication between field crews and back office |
| TechnicalAdvisor | Provides remote guidance on complex installation or repair issues |

## Entities

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { communicateCoworkersCoordinateInstallationsRepairs } from '@headlessly/communicate-coworkers-coordinate-installations-repairs'

const coordination = communicateCoworkersCoordinateInstallationsRepairs()

// Assign a crew to an HVAC installation
const assignment = await coordination.assignCrew({
  workOrderId: 'WO-4821',
  technicians: ['tech-101', 'tech-204'],
  scheduledDate: '2026-03-15',
  site: 'Building C, Floor 3'
})

// Share job details with the assigned crew
await coordination.shareJobDetails({
  workOrderId: 'WO-4821',
  specifications: { type: 'HVAC Installation', model: 'Carrier 50XC' },
  siteReport: { accessCode: '7734', contactName: 'Frank Davis' }
})

// Update progress from the field
await coordination.updateProgress({
  workOrderId: 'WO-4821',
  status: 'in-progress',
  percentComplete: 65,
  notes: 'Ductwork routed, awaiting condenser unit placement'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify dispatcher when an issue is escalated
coordination.issueEscalated(async ({ workOrderId, issue, technicianId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'dispatch-team',
    message: `Issue on ${workOrderId}: ${issue.description} - reported by ${technicianId}`
  })
})

// Trigger inspection scheduling when work is completed
coordination.completionConfirmed(async ({ workOrderId, site }) => {
  await scheduleInspection({
    workOrderId,
    site,
    inspectorPool: 'safety-inspectors'
  })
})
```
