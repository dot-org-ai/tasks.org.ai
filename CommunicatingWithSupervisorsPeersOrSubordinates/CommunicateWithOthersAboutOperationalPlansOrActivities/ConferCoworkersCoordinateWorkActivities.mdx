## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { conferCoworkersCoordinateWorkActivities } from '@headlessly/confer-coworkers-coordinate-work-activities'

const coordination = conferCoworkersCoordinateWorkActivities()

// Hold a morning standup meeting
const standup = await coordination.conductStandup({
  team: 'operations-alpha',
  date: '2026-02-10',
  attendees: ['alice', 'bob', 'carlos', 'diana'],
  agenda: ['Yesterday review', 'Today priorities', 'Blockers']
})

// Assign a task to a team member
await coordination.assignTask({
  title: 'Complete inventory audit for warehouse section B',
  assignee: 'bob',
  dueDate: '2026-02-11',
  priority: 'high',
  dependencies: ['task-inv-audit-section-a']
})

// Share a progress update
await coordination.shareUpdate({
  taskId: 'task-inv-audit-section-a',
  status: 'in-progress',
  percentComplete: 75,
  notes: 'Section A shelves 1-6 complete, shelves 7-8 remaining'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify team lead when assistance is requested
coordination.assistanceRequested(async ({ taskId, requestedBy, reason }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'team-lead',
    message: `${requestedBy} needs help on task ${taskId}: ${reason}`
  })
})

// Auto-create handoff notes at shift end
coordination.standupConducted(async ({ team, date, actionItems }) => {
  for (const item of actionItems.filter(a => a.status === 'in-progress')) {
    await coordination.documentHandoff({
      taskId: item.taskId,
      notes: item.summary,
      nextShift: 'evening'
    })
  }
})
```
