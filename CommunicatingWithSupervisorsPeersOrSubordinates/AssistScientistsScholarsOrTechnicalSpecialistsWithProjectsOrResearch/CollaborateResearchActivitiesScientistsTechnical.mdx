# Collaborate on Research Activities with Scientists or Technical Specialists

> Business-as-Code definition for collaborating on research activities with scientists or technical specialists. Models the interdisciplinary collaboration process where professionals work alongside researchers to design studies, collect data, analyze results, and co-develop findings across scientific and technical domains.

## Overview

Collaborating on research activities with scientists or technical specialists involves coordinating research design, sharing technical expertise, jointly conducting experiments or field work, co-analyzing data, and contributing to shared publications and reports. This definition covers laboratory research partnerships, field study collaborations, cross-functional R&D projects, and multi-institutional research consortia, enabling teams to pool specialized knowledge and resources for more effective scientific investigation.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { collaborateResearchActivitiesScientistsTechnical } from '@headlessly/collaborate-research-activities-scientists-technical'

const research = collaborateResearchActivitiesScientistsTechnical()

// Initiate a new collaboration
const project = await research.initiateCollaboration({
  title: 'Advanced Battery Electrolyte Characterization',
  partners: ['MIT Materials Lab', 'Argonne National Laboratory'],
  duration: { months: 18 },
  fundingSource: 'DOE-ARPA-E',
  ipArrangement: 'joint-ownership'
})

// Design the study together
await research.designStudy({
  projectId: project.id,
  methodology: 'electrochemical-impedance-spectroscopy',
  sampleSize: 240,
  variables: ['electrolyte-composition', 'temperature', 'cycling-rate'],
  responsibilities: [
    { partner: 'MIT Materials Lab', task: 'sample-synthesis' },
    { partner: 'Argonne National Laboratory', task: 'spectroscopic-analysis' }
  ]
})

// Report progress to funder
await research.reportProgress({
  projectId: project.id,
  period: 'Q1-2026',
  milestones: [
    { milestone: 'sample-preparation', status: 'complete' },
    { milestone: 'initial-characterization', status: 'in-progress', completion: 65 }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify all partners when experiments are completed
research.experimentConducted(async ({ projectId, experiment }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'collaboration-team',
    message: `Experiment ${experiment} completed - data available for analysis`
  })
})

// Alert funding agency when publications are ready
research.publicationCoAuthored(async ({ projectId, title }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'funding-agency',
    message: `Publication ready for ${projectId}: ${title}`
  })
})
```
