# Assist Engineers or Scientists with Research

> Business-as-Code definition for assisting engineers or scientists with research. Models the technical support process where research technicians, laboratory assistants, and junior professionals help engineers and scientists conduct experiments, collect measurements, maintain equipment, process data, and prepare technical documentation.

## Overview

Assisting engineers or scientists with research involves setting up laboratory or field equipment, collecting and recording experimental data, performing routine tests, maintaining research instruments, processing samples, and helping prepare technical reports and presentations. This definition covers laboratory research support, field data collection, prototype testing assistance, and computational analysis support, enabling research teams to operate efficiently by distributing technical tasks across support personnel.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { assistEngineersScientistsResearch } from '@headlessly/assist-engineers-scientists-research'

const labAssist = assistEngineersScientistsResearch()

// Set up equipment for a materials testing experiment
await labAssist.setupEquipment({
  experiment: 'tensile-strength-composite-2026',
  instruments: [
    { name: 'Universal Testing Machine', calibration: 'verified', range: '0-100kN' },
    { name: 'Strain Gauge System', calibration: 'verified', sensitivity: '0.01mm' }
  ],
  safetyChecklist: 'mechanical-testing-safety-v3'
})

// Collect data during testing
await labAssist.collectData({
  experiment: 'tensile-strength-composite-2026',
  samples: 24,
  measurements: ['load-at-yield', 'elongation-at-break', 'elastic-modulus'],
  recordingMethod: 'automated-data-acquisition'
})

// Compile results for the lead engineer
await labAssist.compileResults({
  experiment: 'tensile-strength-composite-2026',
  format: 'structured-csv',
  summary: true,
  statisticalAnalysis: ['mean', 'standard-deviation', 'confidence-interval']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert researcher when data collection completes
labAssist.dataCollected(async ({ experiment, samples }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'principal-engineer',
    message: `Data collection complete for ${experiment}: ${samples} samples tested`
  })
})

// Schedule maintenance when equipment thresholds are reached
labAssist.routineTestsConducted(async ({ instrument, usageCount }) => {
  if (usageCount % 100 === 0) {
    await labAssist.maintainInstruments({ instrument, type: 'scheduled-calibration' })
  }
})
```
