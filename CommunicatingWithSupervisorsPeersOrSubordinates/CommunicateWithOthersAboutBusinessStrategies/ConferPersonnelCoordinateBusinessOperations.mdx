## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { conferPersonnelCoordinateBusinessOperations } from '@headlessly/confer-personnel-coordinate-business-operations'

const ops = conferPersonnelCoordinateBusinessOperations()

// Schedule a weekly operations coordination meeting
const meeting = await ops.scheduleCoordination({
  frequency: 'weekly',
  day: 'Monday',
  time: '09:00',
  attendees: ['production-lead', 'logistics-lead', 'customer-service-lead', 'it-support']
})

// Share a status update from production
await ops.shareStatusUpdate({
  department: 'Production',
  period: 'week-10',
  metrics: {
    outputVsTarget: '94%',
    downtime: '2.5 hours',
    qualityYield: '99.1%'
  },
  issues: ['Machine 4 intermittent fault reducing throughput']
})

// Create an action plan to resolve the bottleneck
await ops.createActionPlan({
  issue: 'Machine 4 intermittent fault',
  steps: [
    { action: 'Schedule preventive maintenance', owner: 'maintenance-lead', dueDate: '2026-03-12' },
    { action: 'Reroute production to Machine 5', owner: 'production-lead', dueDate: '2026-03-10' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert leadership when an issue is escalated
ops.issueEscalated(async ({ issue, department, escalatedBy }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'operations-director',
    message: `Escalation from ${department}: ${issue} - raised by ${escalatedBy}`
  })
})

// Auto-send status summaries after each coordination meeting
ops.statusUpdateShared(async ({ department, period, metrics }) => {
  await dashboard.update({
    department,
    period,
    metrics,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  })
})
```
