## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { discussDesignsPlansClients } from '@headlessly/discuss-designs-plans-clients'

const designReview = discussDesignsPlansClients()

// Schedule design review meeting with client
const meeting = await designReview.scheduleReviewMeeting({
  clientId: 'client-88888',
  projectId: 'proj-12345',
  designLeadId: 'designer-555',
  scheduledFor: '2026-02-12T14:00:00Z',
  agenda: 'Present initial website homepage design concepts',
  designsToReview: ['concept-A', 'concept-B', 'concept-C']
})

// Present design concepts to client
const presentation = await designReview.presentDesign({
  meetingId: meeting.id,
  designs: [
    {
      conceptId: 'concept-A',
      name: 'Modern Minimalist',
      assets: ['homepage-desktop.png', 'homepage-mobile.png'],
      description: 'Clean layout with focus on product imagery',
      keyFeatures: ['Hero video', 'Parallax scrolling', 'Minimal navigation']
    },
    {
      conceptId: 'concept-B',
      name: 'Bold Typography',
      assets: ['homepage-alt.png'],
      description: 'Statement typography with vibrant color palette',
      keyFeatures: ['Large headings', 'Geometric shapes', 'Brand colors']
    }
  ]
})

// Gather client feedback
const feedback = await designReview.gatherClientFeedback({
  presentationId: presentation.id,
  clientInput: {
    preferredConcept: 'concept-A',
    requestedChanges: [
      'Reduce hero video to static image for faster loading',
      'Add testimonial section above footer',
      'Incorporate brand blue color (#003B73) in call-to-action buttons'
    ],
    approvalStatus: 'revisions-required'
  }
})

// Incorporate revisions
await designReview.incorporateRevisions({
  conceptId: 'concept-A',
  feedbackId: feedback.id,
  revisions: {
    changes: feedback.clientInput.requestedChanges,
    iterationNumber: 2,
    estimatedCompletionDate: '2026-02-15'
  }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-notify design team when client feedback requires significant changes
designReview.clientFeedbackGathered(async ({ feedback, projectId }) => {
  if (feedback.requestedChanges.length > 5 || feedback.approvalStatus === 'major-revisions') {
    await notifyDesignTeam({
      project: projectId,
      priority: 'high',
      message: `Client requesting ${feedback.requestedChanges.length} design changes`,
      scheduleReviewMeeting: true
    })
  }
})

// Track approval cycle duration metrics
designReview.reviewMeetingScheduled(async ({ meetingId, scheduledFor, projectId }) => {
  await trackMetric({
    metric: 'design-review-cycle-start',
    project: projectId,
    timestamp: scheduledFor
  })
})

designReview.approvedDesignFinalized(async ({ designId, projectId, finalizedAt }) => {
  const cycleStart = await getMetric({
    metric: 'design-review-cycle-start',
    project: projectId
  })

  const durationDays = (new Date(finalizedAt) - new Date(cycleStart)) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)

  await trackMetric({
    metric: 'design-approval-cycle-duration',
    project: projectId,
    value: durationDays
  })
})
```
