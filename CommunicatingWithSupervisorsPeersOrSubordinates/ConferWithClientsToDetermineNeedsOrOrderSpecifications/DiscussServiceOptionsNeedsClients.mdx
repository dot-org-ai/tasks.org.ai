## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { discussServiceOptionsNeedsClients } from '@headlessly/discuss-service-options-needs-clients'

const serviceDiscussion = discussServiceOptionsNeedsClients()

// Conduct needs assessment with client
const assessment = await serviceDiscussion.conductNeedsAssessment({
  clientId: 'client-77777',
  consultantId: 'consultant-444',
  assessmentDate: '2026-02-08',
  clientObjectives: [
    'Improve cybersecurity posture',
    'Achieve SOC 2 compliance within 6 months',
    'Train staff on security best practices'
  ],
  currentState: {
    securityTools: ['Basic firewall', 'Antivirus software'],
    complianceStatus: 'None',
    staffTraining: 'Minimal'
  },
  constraints: {
    budget: { max: 50000, currency: 'USD' },
    timeline: { target: '2026-08-01' }
  }
})

// Identify service gaps
const gaps = await serviceDiscussion.identifyServiceGaps({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  identifiedGaps: [
    {
      category: 'infrastructure',
      gap: 'No intrusion detection system',
      priority: 'high'
    },
    {
      category: 'compliance',
      gap: 'Missing documented security policies',
      priority: 'critical'
    },
    {
      category: 'training',
      gap: 'No phishing awareness program',
      priority: 'medium'
    }
  ]
})

// Present service options
const options = await serviceDiscussion.presentServiceOptions({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  serviceOfferings: [
    {
      name: 'Security Infrastructure Setup',
      description: 'Deploy IDS, SIEM, and endpoint detection tools',
      duration: '4 weeks',
      cost: 18000
    },
    {
      name: 'SOC 2 Compliance Program',
      description: 'Policy development, controls implementation, audit preparation',

      duration: '12 months',
      cost: 6000
    }
  ]
})

// Customize service bundle
const bundle = await serviceDiscussion.customizeServiceBundle({
  clientId: 'client-77777',
  selectedServices: options.serviceOfferings.map(s => s.name),
  customizations: {
    addOns: ['24/7 SOC monitoring for first 90 days'],

  recommendation: {
    rationale: 'Comprehensive approach addresses all critical gaps within timeline and budget',
    phasing: [
      { phase: 1, services: ['Security Infrastructure Setup'], weeks: '1-4' },

})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-suggest complementary services based on needs assessment
serviceDiscussion.needsAssessmentConducted(async ({ assessmentId, clientObjectives }) => {
  if (clientObjectives.some(obj => obj.includes('compliance'))) {
    const complementary = await getComplementaryServices({
      category: 'compliance',
      exclude: ['audit-services'] // Already in assessment
    })

    await serviceDiscussion.suggestAdditionalOptions({
      assessmentId,
      suggestions: complementary
    })
  }
})

// Track proposal conversion rates
serviceDiscussion.serviceProposalPrepared(async ({ proposalId, clientId, totalValue }) => {
  await trackMetric({
    metric: 'proposal-created',
    client: clientId,
    value: totalValue,
    timestamp: new Date()
  })

  // Set reminder to follow up in 7 days
  setTimeout(async () => {
    const status = await getProposalStatus(proposalId)
    if (status === 'pending') {
      await scheduleFollowUp({
        consultant: 'assigned-consultant',
        client: clientId,
        proposalId,
        suggestedDate: new Date(Date.now() + 2 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // +2 days
      })
    }
  }, 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // 7 days
})
```
