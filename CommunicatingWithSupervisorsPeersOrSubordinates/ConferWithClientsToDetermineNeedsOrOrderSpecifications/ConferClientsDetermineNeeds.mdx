# Confer Clients Determine Needs

> Business-as-Code definition for conferring with clients to determine needs. Models the discovery and requirements-gathering process where service providers engage with clients to understand their objectives, constraints, and priorities before proposing solutions.

## Overview

Conferring with clients to determine needs involves conducting structured conversations, interviews, and discovery sessions to understand a client's business objectives, pain points, constraints, and success criteria. This activity is foundational to professional services, consulting, healthcare, legal work, and any engagement where the provider must first understand the client's situation before delivering a solution. The discovery process produces a clear set of documented requirements that guide subsequent planning, design, and delivery activities.

| SubjectMatterExpert | A specialist who provides domain-specific insight during needs assessment |
| ProcurementOffice | The client department responsible for budgetary approval and contract terms |
| ReferralSource | A third party who introduced the client and may provide background context |

| validateUnderstanding | Confirm with the client that documented needs accurately reflect their expectations |
| defineScope | Establish the boundaries of the engagement based on assessed needs |
| presentFindings | Share the results of the needs assessment with the client and internal teams |

## Events

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { conferClientsDetermineNeeds } from '@headlessly/confer-clients-determine-needs'

const discovery = conferClientsDetermineNeeds()

// Schedule a discovery session with a new client
const session = await discovery.scheduleDiscovery({
  client: 'acme-manufacturing',
  accountManager: 'sarah-johnson',
  participants: ['cto-acme', 'ops-director-acme', 'solutions-consultant'],
  scheduledDate: '2026-02-12',
  topics: ['current-systems', 'pain-points', 'growth-objectives']
})

// Conduct the needs assessment
const assessment = await discovery.conductNeedsAssessment({
  sessionId: session.id,
  client: 'acme-manufacturing',
  areas: ['inventory-management', 'order-fulfillment', 'reporting']
})

// Document and prioritize requirements
await discovery.documentRequirements({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  requirements: [
    { need: 'Real-time inventory visibility across 3 warehouses', category: 'inventory-management' },
    { need: 'Automated reorder triggers at threshold levels', category: 'order-fulfillment' },
    { need: 'Custom dashboard for executive KPI reporting', category: 'reporting' }
  ]
})

await discovery.prioritizeNeeds({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  priorities: [
    { requirement: 'real-time-inventory', urgency: 'high', importance: 'critical' },
    { requirement: 'automated-reorder', urgency: 'medium', importance: 'high' },
    { requirement: 'executive-dashboard', urgency: 'low', importance: 'medium' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-generate scope document when understanding is validated
discovery.understandingValidated(async ({ assessmentId, clientId }) => {
  await discovery.defineScope({
    assessmentId,
    clientId,
    template: 'standard-engagement'
  })
})

// Notify internal team when findings are ready for presentation
discovery.requirementsDocumented(async ({ assessmentId, requirementCount }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'engagement-team',
    message: `${requirementCount} requirements documented for assessment ${assessmentId}. Ready for prioritization and review.`
  })
})
```
