# Confer Clients Exchange Information

> Business-as-Code definition for conferring with clients to exchange information. Models the bidirectional communication process where service providers and clients share updates, data, documentation, and feedback to support ongoing engagements.

## Overview

Conferring with clients to exchange information involves the regular, structured sharing of data, status updates, documentation, and feedback between service providers and their clients throughout an engagement. Unlike initial needs discovery, this activity focuses on ongoing communication that keeps both parties aligned as work progresses. It includes sharing project updates, exchanging technical data, providing and receiving deliverable feedback, and coordinating on decisions that require mutual input. This continuous information exchange builds trust, reduces misunderstandings, and ensures that deliverables remain aligned with evolving client expectations.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { conferClientsExchangeInformation } from '@headlessly/confer-clients-exchange-information'

const exchange = conferClientsExchangeInformation()

// Schedule a bi-weekly client conference
const conference = await exchange.scheduleConference({
  client: 'meridian-financial',
  frequency: 'bi-weekly',
  nextDate: '2026-02-14',
  attendees: ['account-manager', 'project-lead', 'client-cfo', 'client-it-director'],
  agenda: ['project-status', 'data-migration-progress', 'open-items-review']
})

// Share a project deliverable with the client
await exchange.shareDocument({
  client: 'meridian-financial',
  document: {
    name: 'Q1-Integration-Progress-Report.pdf',
    type: 'progress-report',
    confidentiality: 'client-confidential'
  },
  recipients: ['client-cfo', 'client-it-director'],
  channel: 'secure-portal'
})

// Request missing data from the client
await exchange.requestInformation({
  client: 'meridian-financial',
  request: {
    description: 'Historical transaction data for fiscal years 2023-2025',
    format: 'CSV or database export',
    dueDate: '2026-02-21',

})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

// Auto-log all document exchanges
exchange.documentShared(async ({ client, document, sharedAt }) => {
  await exchange.updateCommunicationLog({
    client,
    entry: `Document shared: ${document.name}`,
    timestamp: sharedAt,
    type: 'document-exchange'
  })
})

// Follow up on overdue information requests
exchange.informationRequested(async ({ client, request }) => {
  setTimeout(async () => {
    const pending = await exchange.getPendingRequests({ client })
    const overdue = pending.filter(r => r.id === request.id)
    if (overdue.length > 0) {
      await notify({
        to: 'account-manager',
        message: `Information request overdue from ${client}: "${request.description}"`
      })
    }
  }, 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // 7 days
})
```
