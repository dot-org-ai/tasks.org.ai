## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { translateInformationOthers } from '@headlessly/translate-information-others'

const translation = translateInformationOthers()

// Assess scope and translate a legal document
const scope = await translation.assessTranslationScope({
  sourceLanguage: 'en',
  targetLanguage: 'es',
  documentType: 'employment-contract',
  wordCount: 4500,
  certificationRequired: true
})

await translation.buildGlossary({
  scopeId: scope.id,
  domain: 'legal-employment',
  languagePair: 'en-es'
})

const translated = await translation.translateDocument({
  scopeId: scope.id,
  sourceDocument: 'employment-agreement-2026.pdf',
  preserveFormatting: true
})

await translation.reviewTranslation({ translationId: translated.id })
await translation.certifyTranslation({
  translationId: translated.id,
  certifier: 'ata-certified-translator-1247'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-review when translation is complete
translation.documentTranslated(async ({ translationId }) => {
  await translation.reviewTranslation({ translationId })
})

// Notify requesting party when translation is delivered
translation.translationDelivered(async ({ translationId, client, languagePair }) => {
  await notify({
    to: client,
    message: `Your ${languagePair} translation is ready for download`
  })
})
```
