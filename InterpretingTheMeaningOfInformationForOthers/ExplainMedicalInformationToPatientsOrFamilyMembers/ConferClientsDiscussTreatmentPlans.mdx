# Confer with Clients to Discuss Treatment Plans or Progress

> Business-as-Code definition for conferring with clients about treatment plans and progress.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { conferClientsDiscussTreatmentPlans } from '@headlessly/confer-clients-discuss-treatment-plans'

const treatment = conferClientsDiscussTreatmentPlans()

// Schedule and conduct a treatment review
const conference = await treatment.scheduleConference({
  client: 'client-2026-3092',
  provider: 'therapist-jdavis',
  date: '2026-02-14',
  type: '90-day-review'
})

const review = await treatment.reviewTreatmentGoals({
  conferenceId: conference.id,
  goals: [
    { goal: 'reduce-anxiety-symptoms', baseline: 28, current: 18, target: 12, measure: 'GAD-7' },
    { goal: 'improve-sleep-quality', baseline: 'poor', current: 'fair', target: 'good' },
    { goal: 'increase-social-engagement', baseline: 1, current: 3, target: 5, unit: 'events-per-week' }
  ]
})

// Identify barriers and adjust
await treatment.identifyBarriers({
  conferenceId: conference.id,
  barriers: [
    { barrier: 'work-schedule-conflict', impact: 'missed-sessions', mitigation: 'telehealth-option' }
  ]
})

await treatment.adjustTreatmentPlan({
  conferenceId: conference.id,
  adjustments: [
    { goal: 'reduce-anxiety-symptoms', change: 'add-mindfulness-component' },
    { intervention: 'session-format', change: 'alternate-in-person-telehealth' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify referring provider when outcomes are measured
treatment.outcomeMeasured(async ({ client, measure, score }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'referring-provider',
    message: `${measure} score for ${client}: ${score} - review progress report`
  })
})

// Alert care coordinator when barriers are identified
treatment.barriersIdentified(async ({ client, barriers }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'care-coordinator',
    message: `${barriers.length} barriers identified for ${client} - mitigation needed`
  })
})
```
