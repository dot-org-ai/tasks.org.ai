## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { communicateDetailedMedicalInformationPatients } from '@headlessly/communicate-detailed-medical-information-patients'

const medical = communicateDetailedMedicalInformationPatients()

// Disclose diagnosis and explain options
await medical.discloseDiagnosis({
  patient: 'patient-2026-4521',
  diagnosis: 'Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus',
  severity: 'moderate',
  familyPresent: ['spouse'],
  interpreterNeeded: false
})

await medical.explainTreatmentOptions({
  patient: 'patient-2026-4521',
  options: [
    { treatment: 'lifestyle-modification', risks: 'minimal', timeline: 'ongoing' },
    { treatment: 'metformin-therapy', risks: 'gi-side-effects', timeline: '3-month-trial' },
    { treatment: 'combination-therapy', risks: 'hypoglycemia', timeline: '6-month-review' }

})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Provide education materials after diagnosis disclosure
medical.diagnosisDisclosed(async ({ patient, diagnosis }) => {
  await sendEducationMaterials({
    to: patient,
    condition: diagnosis,
    format: 'patient-portal'
  })
})

// Alert care team when informed consent is obtained
medical.informedConsentObtained(async ({ patient, treatment }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'care-coordination',
    message: `Consent obtained for ${treatment} - proceed with treatment initiation`
