## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { communicateOrganizationalPoliciesProcedures } from '@headlessly/communicate-organizational-policies-procedures'

const policies = communicateOrganizationalPoliciesProcedures()

// Draft and approve a new policy
const policy = await policies.draftPolicy({
  title: 'Remote Work Policy',
  category: 'workplace-flexibility',
  applicableTo: ['all-employees'],
  effectiveDate: '2026-03-01'
})

await policies.reviewForCompliance({ policyId: policy.id })
await policies.approvePolicy({ policyId: policy.id, approver: 'vp-human-resources' })

// Distribute and train
await policies.distributePolicy({
  policyId: policy.id,
  channels: ['email', 'intranet', 'employee-portal'],
  acknowledgmentRequired: true
})

await policies.conductPolicyTraining({
  policyId: policy.id,
  sessions: [
    { date: '2026-02-20', format: 'webinar', audience: 'all-managers' },
    { date: '2026-02-25', format: 'recorded', audience: 'all-employees' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Remind employees who haven't acknowledged
policies.policyDistributed(async ({ policyId, deadline }) => {
  setTimeout(async () => {
    const pending = await policies.findPendingAcknowledgments({ policyId })
    if (pending.length > 0) {
      await notify({
        to: pending.map(e => e.email),
        message: `Please acknowledge the new policy by ${deadline}`
      })
    }
  }, 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // 7 days
})

// Notify HR when all acknowledgments are collected
policies.acknowledgmentsCollected(async ({ policyId, completionRate }) => {
  if (completionRate === 100) {
    await notify({
      to: 'hr-compliance',
      message: `100% acknowledgment achieved for policy ${policyId}`
    })
  }
})
