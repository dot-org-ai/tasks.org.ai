```typescript
import { communicateClientsAboutProductsProcedures } from '@headlessly/communicate-clients-about-products-procedures'

const clientComms = communicateClientsAboutProductsProcedures()

// Notify client about product update
await clientComms.notifyProductUpdate({
  client: 'Apex Financial Group',
  product: 'Risk Analytics Platform',
  update: 'v3.2 release',
  changes: ['enhanced-scenario-modeling', 'new-regulatory-reports', 'api-v2-deprecation'],

await clientComms.explainProcedure({
  client: 'Apex Financial Group',
  procedure: 'Annual Data Certification',
  steps: ['review-data-accuracy', 'sign-certification-form', 'submit-by-deadline'],
  deadline: '2026-06-30'

  await clientComms.documentInteraction({
    client,
    type: 'question-response',
    summary: question,
    details: response
