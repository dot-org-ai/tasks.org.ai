## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { explainUseProductsServices } from '@headlessly/explain-use-products-services'

const usage = explainUseProductsServices()

// Schedule and deliver a product demo
const demo = await usage.scheduleDemo({
  customer: 'Meridian Manufacturing',
  product: 'CNC Precision Controller v4',
  format: 'on-site',
  date: '2026-02-20'
})

await usage.demonstrateFeatures({
  demoId: demo.id,
  features: ['auto-calibration', 'multi-axis-control', 'remote-monitoring'],
  audience: ['machine-operators', 'floor-supervisor']
})

await usage.explainOperatingProcedures({
  demoId: demo.id,
  procedures: ['initial-setup', 'daily-startup', 'emergency-shutdown']
})

// Assess and follow up
const adoption = await usage.assessAdoption({
  customer: 'Meridian Manufacturing',
  product: 'CNC Precision Controller v4',
  metrics: ['feature-utilization', 'error-rate', 'uptime']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Send usage guide after demo
usage.featuresDemo(async ({ demoId, product }) => {
  await usage.provideUsageGuide({ demoId, product, format: 'pdf' })
})

// Alert CSM on low adoption
usage.adoptionAssessed(async ({ customer, adoptionScore }) => {
  if (adoptionScore < 60) {
    await notify({
      to: 'customer-success',
      message: `Low adoption (${adoptionScore}%) for ${customer} - follow-up needed`
    })
  }
})
```
