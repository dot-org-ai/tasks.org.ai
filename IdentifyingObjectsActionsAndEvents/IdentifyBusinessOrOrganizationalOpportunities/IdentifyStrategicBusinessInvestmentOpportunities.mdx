## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { identifyStrategicBusinessInvestmentOpportunities } from '@headlessly/identify-strategic-business-investment-opportunities'

const strategy = identifyStrategicBusinessInvestmentOpportunities()

// Scan market for acquisition targets in the healthcare SaaS space
const landscape = await strategy.scanMarket({
  sectors: ['Healthcare IT', 'Clinical SaaS'],
  geography: 'North America',
  revenueRange: { min: 10000000, max: 100000000 }
})

// Screen and assess a specific target
const target = await strategy.screenTarget({
  companyId: landscape.candidates[0].id,
  criteria: { minGrossMargin: 0.65, maxChurnRate: 0.08, minRevenueGrowth: 0.20 }
})

const fit = await strategy.assessStrategicFit({
  targetId: target.id,
  objectives: ['market-expansion', 'product-portfolio', 'talent-acquisition']
})

// Model synergies and build the investment case
await strategy.modelSynergies({
  targetId: target.id,
  scenarios: ['conservative', 'base', 'optimistic'],
  integrationCosts: 5000000
})

await strategy.buildInvestmentCase({
  targetId: target.id,
  dealStructure: 'all-cash',
  proposedValuation: 85000000
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Route approved investments to integration planning
strategy.investmentApproved(async ({ targetId, dealValue, closingDate }) => {
  await strategy.initializeIntegration({
    targetId,
    workstreams: ['finance', 'technology', 'people', 'operations'],
    targetCloseDate: closingDate
  })
})

// Alert strategy team when due diligence reveals material findings
strategy.dueDiligenceCompleted(async ({ targetId, findings }) => {
  if (findings.materialRisks.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'corporate-development',
      message: `Material risks found in DD for ${targetId}: ${findings.materialRisks.length} items require review`
    })
  }
})
```
