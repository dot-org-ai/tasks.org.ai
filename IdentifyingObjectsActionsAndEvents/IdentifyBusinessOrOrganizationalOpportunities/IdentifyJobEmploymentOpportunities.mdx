## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { identifyJobEmploymentOpportunities } from '@headlessly/identify-job-employment-opportunities'

const careers = identifyJobEmploymentOpportunities()

// Build a candidate profile
const profile = await careers.buildCandidateProfile({
  skills: ['project-management', 'data-analysis', 'stakeholder-communication'],
  experience: { years: 5, industry: 'Healthcare IT' },
  credentials: ['PMP', 'CAPM'],
  preferences: { location: 'Remote', salaryMin: 95000, type: 'full-time' }
})

// Scan the labor market for matching opportunities
const market = await careers.analyzeLaborMarket({
  occupations: ['Project Manager', 'Program Manager', 'Business Analyst'],
  region: 'US-National'
})

const jobs = await careers.scanOpportunities({
  profileId: profile.id,
  sources: ['LinkedIn', 'Indeed', 'Glassdoor'],
  limit: 25
})

// Score and evaluate top matches
for (const job of jobs.items.slice(0, 5)) {
  await careers.scoreMatch({ profileId: profile.id, opportunityId: job.id })
  await careers.evaluateEmployer({ employerId: job.employerId })
}
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-add high-scoring matches to the pipeline
careers.matchScored(async ({ profileId, opportunityId, score }) => {
  if (score.overall >= 85) {
    await careers.addToPipeline({ profileId, opportunityId, priority: 'high' })
    await notify({
      to: 'job-seeker',
      message: `Strong match found: ${score.overall}% fit - added to your pipeline`
    })
  }
})

// Alert when a skills gap blocks multiple opportunities
careers.skillsGapAssessed(async ({ profileId, gaps }) => {
  const criticalGaps = gaps.filter(g => g.frequency >= 3)
  if (criticalGaps.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'career-counselor',
      message: `Candidate has recurring gaps in: ${criticalGaps.map(g => g.skill).join(', ')}`
    })
  }
})
```
