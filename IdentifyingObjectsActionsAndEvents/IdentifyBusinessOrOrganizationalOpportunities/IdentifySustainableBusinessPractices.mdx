## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { identifySustainableBusinessPractices } from '@headlessly/identify-sustainable-business-practices'

const sustainability = identifySustainableBusinessPractices()

// Conduct a sustainability audit across operations
const audit = await sustainability.conductAudit({
  scope: ['manufacturing', 'supply-chain', 'workforce', 'governance'],
  framework: 'GRI-Standards',
  period: { start: '2025-01-01', end: '2025-12-31' }
})

// Assess materiality to prioritize focus areas
const materiality = await sustainability.assessMateriality({
  auditId: audit.id,
  stakeholders: ['investors', 'employees', 'communities', 'customers'],
  method: 'double-materiality'
})

// Benchmark and identify specific practices
await sustainability.benchmarkESG({
  auditId: audit.id,
  peerGroup: 'SP500-Manufacturing',
  frameworks: ['SASB', 'TCFD']
})

const practice = await sustainability.identifyPractice({
  category: 'circular-economy',
  description: 'Implement closed-loop packaging return program',
  estimatedImpact: { wasteReduction: 0.40, costSavings: 120000 }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify stakeholders when ESG scorecard improves
sustainability.scorecardGenerated(async ({ scorecardId, overall, previous }) => {
  if (overall > previous) {
    await notify({
      to: 'investor-relations',
      message: `ESG score improved from ${previous} to ${overall}`
    })
  }
})

// Trigger corrective action when a supplier falls below standards
sustainability.supplierEvaluated(async ({ supplierId, score, threshold }) => {
  if (score < threshold) {
    await procurement.initiateCorrectiveAction({
      supplierId,
      reason: 'sustainability-non-compliance',
      deadline: '30-days'
    })
  }
})
```
