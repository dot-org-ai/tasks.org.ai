### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { identifyPotentialCustomers } from '@headlessly/identify-potential-customers'

const prospecting = identifyPotentialCustomers()

// Define the ideal customer profile
const profile = await prospecting.defineProfile({
  industry: ['SaaS', 'FinTech'],
  companySize: { min: 50, max: 500 },
  revenue: { min: 5000000, max: 100000000 },
  geography: ['US', 'CA', 'UK'],
  technographics: ['Salesforce', 'AWS']
})

// Source leads from a data provider
const leads = await prospecting.sourceLeads({
  profileId: profile.id,
  source: 'ZoomInfo',
  limit: 500
})

// Enrich and score each prospect
for (const lead of leads.items) {
  await prospecting.enrichProspect({
    prospectId: lead.id,
    providers: ['Clearbit', 'Bombora']
  })

  await prospecting.scoreProspect({
    prospectId: lead.id,
    profileId: profile.id

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-qualify and route high-scoring leads
prospecting.prospectScored(async ({ prospectId, score }) => {
  if (score.overall >= 80) {
    await prospecting.qualifyLead({ prospectId })
    await prospecting.handoffToSales({
      prospectId,
      assignTo: 'round-robin',
      priority: 'high'
    })
  }
})

// Notify sales when a prospect list is ready for outreach
prospecting.prospectListBuilt(async ({ listId, count, segment }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'sales-team',
    message: `New prospect list ready: ${count} qualified leads in ${segment}`
  })
})
