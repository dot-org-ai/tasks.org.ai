# Identify New Applications for Existing Technologies

> Business-as-Code definition for identifying new applications for existing technologies. Models the process of cataloging organizational technology assets, mapping them to unmet market needs, and validating novel use cases that can unlock additional revenue or operational value.

## Overview

Identifying new applications for existing technologies involves surveying an organization's current technology portfolio and matching capabilities against emerging market demands, adjacent industries, and internal operational challenges. This definition provides actions for technology audit, use case ideation, feasibility assessment, and proof-of-concept planning. It helps organizations maximize the return on prior technology investments by extending platforms, algorithms, or processes into new domains.

| buildProofOfConcept | Develop a minimal prototype demonstrating the technology in the new context |
| prioritizePipeline | Rank new applications by strategic value, feasibility, and time to market |
| proposeCommercialization | Present a validated application for commercialization funding |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| technologyAudited | An inventory of technology assets and capabilities is complete |
| useCaseIdeated | A new potential application has been documented |
| feasibilityAssessed | A technical and market viability assessment has been finalized |
| patentLandscapeAnalyzed | An IP landscape review for the proposed application is complete |
| marketSized | An addressable market estimate for the new application is available |
| proofOfConceptCompleted | A prototype has been built and validated for the new use case |
| pipelinePrioritized | New applications have been ranked and the pipeline is updated |
| commercializationProposed | A validated application has been submitted for funding |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| findTechnologyAssets | List technology assets by type, domain, or readiness level |
| getUseCases | Retrieve ideated use cases filtered by technology, market, or status |
| getFeasibilityReports | Query feasibility assessments by use case or outcome |
| getMarketOpportunities | Look up market sizing data by application or sector |
| getPipeline | Retrieve the current prioritized application pipeline |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { identifyNewApplicationsExistingTechnologies } from '@headlessly/identify-new-applications-existing-technologies'

const innovation = identifyNewApplicationsExistingTechnologies()

// Audit current technology portfolio
const assets = await innovation.auditTechnology({
  organization: 'acme-corp',
  categories: ['machine-learning', 'computer-vision', 'natural-language-processing']
})

// Ideate new use cases for a computer vision platform
const useCase = await innovation.ideateUseCases({
  technologyId: assets.items[0].id,
  targetIndustries: ['Agriculture', 'Manufacturing QA', 'Retail Analytics'],
  method: 'cross-industry-mapping'
})

// Assess feasibility and size the market
const feasibility = await innovation.assessFeasibility({
  useCaseId: useCase.items[0].id,
  dimensions: ['technical', 'market', 'regulatory']
})

const market = await innovation.sizeMarket({
  useCaseId: useCase.items[0].id,
  geography: 'Global',
  methodology: 'top-down'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-trigger proof of concept when feasibility is confirmed
innovation.feasibilityAssessed(async ({ useCaseId, result }) => {
  if (result.overall === 'viable') {
    await innovation.buildProofOfConcept({
      useCaseId,
      timeline: '8-weeks',
      budget: 50000
    })
  }
})

// Notify product team when market opportunity exceeds threshold
innovation.marketSized(async ({ useCaseId, tam }) => {
  if (tam >= 500000000) {
    await notify({
      to: 'product-leadership',
      message: `High-value market opportunity: $${tam / 1000000}M TAM for use case ${useCaseId}`
    })
  }
})
```
