## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { identifyInvestmentOpportunitiesStrategies } from '@headlessly/identify-investment-opportunities-strategies'

const investments = identifyInvestmentOpportunitiesStrategies()

// Define screening criteria for mid-cap growth equities
const criteria = await investments.defineScreeningCriteria({
  assetClass: 'equity',
  marketCap: { min: 2000000000, max: 10000000000 },
  revenueGrowth: { min: 0.15 },
  peRatio: { max: 35 },
  sectors: ['Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Clean Energy']
})

// Screen the market and analyze top candidates
const candidates = await investments.screenMarket({
  criteriaId: criteria.id,
  universe: 'US-Listed',
  limit: 50
})

const analysis = await investments.analyzeOpportunity({
  opportunityId: candidates.items[0].id,
  methods: ['dcf', 'comparableCompanies', 'technicalMomentum']
})

// Formulate and score the investment thesis
await investments.formulateThesis({
  opportunityId: candidates.items[0].id,
  catalyst: 'Regulatory tailwind from infrastructure spending bill',
  targetReturn: 0.25,
  timeHorizon: '18-months'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert the portfolio team when a high-conviction opportunity surfaces
investments.opportunityScored(async ({ opportunityId, score, assetClass }) => {
  if (score.conviction >= 9) {
    await notify({
      to: 'investment-committee',
      message: `High-conviction ${assetClass} opportunity scored ${score.conviction}/10`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-generate a recommendation memo when thesis is approved
investments.thesisFormulated(async ({ opportunityId, analyst, thesis }) => {
  await documents.generate({
    template: 'investment-recommendation-memo',
    data: { opportunityId, analyst, thesis },
    distribute: ['portfolio-manager', 'risk-officer']
  })
})
```
