Reviewing environmental permits, plans, or reports involves examining permit applications, environmental impact statements, stormwater management plans, air quality reports, and remediation documentation to verify compliance with EPA, state environmental agency, and local regulatory requirements. This definition provides actions for document intake, regulatory cross-referencing, condition verification, and approval processing. It supports environmental compliance officers, permitting agencies, environmental consultants, and land use planners.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { reviewEnvironmentalPermitsPlansReports } from '@headlessly/review-environmental-permits-plans-reports'

const reviewer = reviewEnvironmentalPermitsPlansReports()

// Receive permit documentation
const review = await reviewer.receivePermitDocumentation({
  applicantId: 'greenfield-development-corp',
  permitType: 'stormwater-discharge',
  projectName: 'Riverside Industrial Park Phase 2',
  documents: ['impact-assessment', 'drainage-plan', 'water-quality-monitoring-plan']
})

// Identify regulations and evaluate
await reviewer.identifyApplicableRegulations({
  reviewId: review.id,
  regulations: ['CWA-NPDES', 'state-stormwater-general-permit', 'local-watershed-ordinance']
})

await reviewer.evaluateImpactAssessment({ reviewId: review.id })

// Approve with conditions
await reviewer.approvePermit({
  reviewId: review.id,
  conditions: ['quarterly-monitoring-reports', 'best-management-practices-installation']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify applicant of deficiencies
reviewer.deficiencyFlagged(async ({ reviewId, applicantId, deficiencyType }) => {
  await notify({
    to: applicantId,
    message: `Environmental permit deficiency: ${deficiencyType}. Please submit corrections.`
  })
})

// Schedule compliance inspection after permit approval
reviewer.permitApproved(async ({ reviewId, permitId }) => {
  await scheduleInspection({ permitId, type: 'initial-compliance', daysFromNow: 90 })
})
```
