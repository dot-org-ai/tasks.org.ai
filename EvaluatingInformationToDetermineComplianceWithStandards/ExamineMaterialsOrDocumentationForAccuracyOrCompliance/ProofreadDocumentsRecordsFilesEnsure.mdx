## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { proofreadDocumentsRecordsFilesEnsure } from '@headlessly/proofread-documents-records-files-ensure'

const proofreader = proofreadDocumentsRecordsFilesEnsure()

// Submit a report for proofreading
const review = await proofreader.submitForProofreading({
  documentId: 'annual-report-2026-draft-v3',
  type: 'annual-report',
  author: 'finance-dept',
  styleGuide: 'corporate-style-guide-v2'
})

// Run review checks
await proofreader.reviewGrammarSpelling({ reviewId: review.id })
await proofreader.verifyDataAccuracy({
  reviewId: review.id,
  sourceMaterials: ['q1-financials', 'q2-financials', 'q3-financials', 'q4-financials']
})
await proofreader.checkFormatting({ reviewId: review.id })

// Approve if clean
await proofreader.approveDocument({ reviewId: review.id })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify author when corrections are needed
proofreader.correctionMarked(async ({ documentId, errorCount, author }) => {
  await notify({
    to: author,
    message: `${errorCount} corrections marked on ${documentId}. Review and confirm changes.`
  })
})

// Distribute approved document
proofreader.documentApproved(async ({ documentId, type }) => {
  await distribute({ documentId, channels: ['publishing', 'records-management'] })
})
```
