## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { reviewLicensePermitApplications } from '@headlessly/review-license-permit-applications'

const reviewer = reviewLicensePermitApplications()

// Receive a building permit application
const app = await reviewer.receiveApplication({
  type: 'commercial-building-permit',
  applicantId: 'builder-apex-022',
  projectAddress: '1400 Industrial Blvd',
  documents: ['site-plan', 'structural-drawings', 'environmental-assessment']
})

// Check completeness and evaluate
await reviewer.checkCompleteness({ applicationId: app.id })
await reviewer.evaluateEligibility({
  applicationId: app.id,
  criteria: ['zoning-commercial', 'setback-requirements', 'fire-code']
})

// Approve and issue
await reviewer.approveApplication({
  applicationId: app.id,
  conditions: ['complete-final-inspection-before-occupancy']
})
await reviewer.issueDocument({ applicationId: app.id })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Schedule inspection when eligibility evaluation requires it
reviewer.eligibilityEvaluated(async ({ applicationId, inspectionRequired }) => {
  if (inspectionRequired) {
    await reviewer.requestInspection({ applicationId, type: 'site-visit' })
  }
})

// Notify applicant of decision
reviewer.applicationApproved(async ({ applicationId, applicantId }) => {
  await notify({ to: applicantId, message: 'Your permit application has been approved.' })
})

reviewer.applicationDenied(async ({ applicationId, applicantId, reasons }) => {
  await notify({ to: applicantId, message: `Permit denied: ${reasons.join(', ')}` })
})
```
