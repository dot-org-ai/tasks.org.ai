## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { verifyShippingDocumentation } from '@headlessly/verify-shipping-documentation'

const verifier = verifyShippingDocumentation()

// Collect all documents for a shipment
const docs = await verifier.collectDocuments({
  shipmentId: 'SHP-2026-02-05-0041',
  documents: ['bill-of-lading', 'commercial-invoice', 'packing-list', 'certificate-of-origin']
})

// Verify bill of lading and cross-reference packing
await verifier.verifyBillOfLading({
  shipmentId: docs.shipmentId,
  expectedContainers: 2,
  expectedWeight: 18400
})

await verifier.crossReferencePacking({
  shipmentId: docs.shipmentId,
  warehouseInventoryId: 'inv-dock-12'
})

// Authorize clearance
await verifier.authorizeClearance({ shipmentId: docs.shipmentId })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Hold shipment on documentation discrepancy
verifier.discrepancyFlagged(async ({ shipmentId, discrepancyType }) => {
  await holdShipment({ shipmentId })
  await notify({
    to: 'trade-compliance',
    message: `Shipping doc discrepancy on ${shipmentId}: ${discrepancyType}`
  })
})

// Notify carrier when clearance is granted
verifier.clearanceAuthorized(async ({ shipmentId }) => {
  await notify({ to: 'freight-carrier', message: `Shipment ${shipmentId} cleared for pickup` })
})
```
