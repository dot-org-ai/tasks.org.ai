## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { examineProductInformationEnsureCompliance } from '@headlessly/examine-product-information-ensure-compliance'

const reviewer = examineProductInformationEnsureCompliance()

// Submit product labeling for review
const submission = await reviewer.submitProductInfo({
  productId: 'prod-sunscreen-spf50',
  category: 'over-the-counter-drug',
  labelVersion: '2.1',
  claims: ['SPF 50', 'Broad Spectrum', 'Water Resistant 80 min']
})

// Identify regulations and verify
await reviewer.identifyApplicableRegulations({
  submissionId: submission.id,
  regulations: ['FDA-OTC-sunscreen-monograph', 'FTC-advertising-guidelines']
})

await reviewer.verifyLabelContent({ submissionId: submission.id })

// Certify if compliant
await reviewer.certifyCompliance({ submissionId: submission.id })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Escalate critical violations
reviewer.violationFlagged(async ({ submissionId, productId, regulation, severity }) => {
  if (severity === 'critical') {
    await notify({
      to: 'compliance-counsel',
      message: `Critical violation on ${productId}: ${regulation}`
    })
  }
})

// Notify retail partners when certification is issued
reviewer.complianceCertified(async ({ productId, certificationId }) => {
  await notifyRetailPartners({ productId, certificationId })
})
```
