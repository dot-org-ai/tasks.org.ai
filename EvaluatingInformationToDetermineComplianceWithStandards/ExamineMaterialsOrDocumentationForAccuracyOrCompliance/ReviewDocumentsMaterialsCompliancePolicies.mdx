### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { reviewDocumentsMaterialsCompliancePolicies } from '@headlessly/review-documents-materials-compliance-policies'

const reviewer = reviewDocumentsMaterialsCompliancePolicies()

// Submit a vendor contract for compliance review
const review = await reviewer.submitForComplianceReview({
  documentId: 'contract-vendor-2026-0088',

})

const evaluation = await reviewer.evaluateCompliance({ reviewId: review.id })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-assign remediation to document owner
reviewer.findingDocumented(async ({ reviewId, findingId, owner }) => {
  await reviewer.assignRemediation({
    findingId,
    assignee: owner,
    deadline: daysFromNow(14)
  })
})

// Distribute review report on completion
reviewer.reviewReportIssued(async ({ reviewId, reportId }) => {
  await distribute({
    reportId,
    recipients: ['compliance-committee', 'cco-office']
  })
})
```
