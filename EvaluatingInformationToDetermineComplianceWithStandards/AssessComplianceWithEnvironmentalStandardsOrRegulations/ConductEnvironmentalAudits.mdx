# Conduct Environmental Audits

> Business-as-Code definition for conducting environmental audits. Models the systematic examination of facility operations, waste management systems, emission controls, and environmental management programs to verify compliance with regulatory requirements and identify areas for improvement.

## Overview

Conducting environmental audits involves planning and executing systematic inspections of facilities, processes, and management systems to evaluate compliance with environmental regulations, permit conditions, and internal environmental policies. This definition provides actions for audit planning, fieldwork execution, evidence collection, finding documentation, and report generation. It supports environmental auditors, EHS managers, regulatory compliance teams, and third-party audit firms.

| CertificationRegistrar | Accredits auditors and recognizes audit outcomes for certification |
| ExternalAuditFirm | Provides independent third-party audit services |
| InsuranceUnderwriter | Uses audit results to assess environmental liability risk |
| CorporateEHSOffice | Commissions audits and oversees corrective action implementation |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { conductEnvironmentalAudits } from '@headlessly/conduct-environmental-audits'

const auditor = conductEnvironmentalAudits()

// Plan an environmental audit
const audit = await auditor.planAudit({
  facilityId: 'chemical-processing-plant-east',
  scope: ['air-emissions', 'wastewater-discharge', 'hazardous-waste-management'],
  criteria: ['EPA-RCRA', 'state-air-permit-conditions', 'ISO-14001'],
  scheduledDate: '2026-03-15',
  team: ['lead-auditor-jones', 'field-auditor-chen', 'hazmat-specialist-park']
})

// Execute the audit
await auditor.conductOpeningMeeting({ auditId: audit.id })
await auditor.executeFieldwork({ auditId: audit.id })

// Document and classify findings
await auditor.documentFinding({
  auditId: audit.id,
  area: 'hazardous-waste-storage',
  description: 'Secondary containment capacity below 110% of largest container',
  regulation: 'RCRA-40-CFR-264.175'
})

// Generate report
await auditor.generateAuditReport({ auditId: audit.id })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Escalate critical findings immediately
auditor.findingClassified(async ({ auditId, findingId, severity, facilityId }) => {
  if (severity === 'critical') {
    await notify({
      to: 'corporate-ehs-director',
      message: `Critical environmental finding at ${facilityId}. Immediate action required.`
    })
  }
})

// Schedule follow-up verification
auditor.correctiveActionRequested(async ({ findingId, dueDate }) => {
  await scheduleTask({
    type: 'closure-verification',
    findingId,
    scheduledDate: dueDate
  })
})
```
