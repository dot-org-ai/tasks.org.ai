### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { conductFinancialRegulatoryAudits } from '@headlessly/conduct-financial-regulatory-audits'

const auditor = conductFinancialRegulatoryAudits()

// Plan an annual financial audit
const engagement = await auditor.planEngagement({
  clientId: 'consolidated-industries-inc',
  fiscalYear: '2025',
  scope: ['balance-sheet', 'income-statement', 'cash-flow', 'equity'],
  materiality: 500000,
  team: ['partner-williams', 'manager-garcia', 'staff-auditor-lee']
})

// Assess risk and test controls
await auditor.assessRisk({ engagementId: engagement.id })
await auditor.testControls({
  engagementId: engagement.id,
  areas: ['revenue-recognition', 'accounts-payable', 'inventory-valuation']
})

// Perform substantive testing and issue opinion
await auditor.performSubstantiveTesting({ engagementId: engagement.id })
await auditor.issueAuditOpinion({ engagementId: engagement.id, type: 'unqualified' })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Escalate material findings to audit committee
auditor.findingDocumented(async ({ engagementId, findingId, severity, amount }) => {
  if (severity === 'material') {
    await notify({
      to: 'audit-committee-chair',
      message: `Material audit finding: ${findingId} ($${amount.toLocaleString()})`
