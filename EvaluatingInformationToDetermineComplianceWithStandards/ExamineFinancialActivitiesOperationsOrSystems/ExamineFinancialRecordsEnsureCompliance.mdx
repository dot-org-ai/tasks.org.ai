## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { examineFinancialRecordsEnsureCompliance } from '@headlessly/examine-financial-records-ensure-compliance'

const examiner = examineFinancialRecordsEnsureCompliance()

// Select records for compliance review
const examination = await examiner.selectRecordsForReview({
  department: 'treasury',
  recordTypes: ['wire-transfers', 'cash-receipts', 'intercompany-transactions'],
  period: { start: '2025-01-01', end: '2025-06-30' }
})

// Map requirements and test compliance
await examiner.mapComplianceRequirements({
  examinationId: examination.id,
  policies: ['corporate-expense-policy', 'segregation-of-duties'],
  regulations: ['SOX-302', 'BSA-AML', 'IRS-recordkeeping']
})

await examiner.testRecordCompliance({ examinationId: examination.id })
await examiner.detectSuspiciousPatterns({ examinationId: examination.id })

// Issue compliance report
await examiner.issueComplianceReport({ examinationId: examination.id })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Escalate suspicious activity immediately
examiner.suspiciousPatternsDetected(async ({ examinationId, transactionIds, riskScore }) => {
  if (riskScore > 80) {
    await notify({
      to: 'aml-investigation-unit',
      message: `High-risk suspicious activity detected. ${transactionIds.length} transactions flagged.`
    })
  }
})

// Track remediation deadlines
examiner.remediationTaskAssigned(async ({ violationId, assignee, deadline }) => {
  await createReminder({ assignee, violationId, reminderDate: daysBefore(deadline, 7) })
})
```
