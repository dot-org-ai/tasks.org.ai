## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { prepareOperationalReportsRecords } from '@headlessly/prepare-operational-reports-records'

const ops = prepareOperationalReportsRecords()

// Collect daily operational data
const data = await ops.collectData({
  sources: ['production-system', 'quality-database', 'maintenance-log'],
  period: '2026-02-04',
  department: 'manufacturing'
})

// Compile and distribute
const report = await ops.compileReport({
  template: 'daily-operations-summary',
  data: data.id,
  title: 'Manufacturing Daily Report - Feb 4, 2026'
})

await ops.distributeReport({
  reportId: report.id,
  recipients: ['plant-manager', 'vp-operations', 'quality-director']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-compile scheduled reports
ops.dataCollected(async ({ sourceId, period, department }) => {
  await ops.compileReport({
    template: `${department}-daily-summary`,
    data: sourceId,
    title: `${department} Daily Report - ${period}`
  })
})

// Alert on metric anomalies during analysis
ops.metricsAnalyzed(async ({ anomalies }) => {
  if (anomalies.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'operations-leadership',
      message: `${anomalies.length} operational anomalies detected - review required`
    })
  }
})
```
