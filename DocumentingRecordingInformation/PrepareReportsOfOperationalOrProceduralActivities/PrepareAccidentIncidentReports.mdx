## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { prepareAccidentIncidentReports } from '@headlessly/prepare-accident-incident-reports'

const incidents = prepareAccidentIncidentReports()

// Initialize a report
const report = await incidents.initializeReport({
  type: 'workplace-injury',
  dateTime: '2026-02-04T14:30:00Z',
  location: 'Warehouse B - Loading Dock 3',
  description: 'Employee struck by forklift while crossing loading area',
  severity: 'serious'
})

// Document injuries and collect statements
await incidents.documentInjuries({
  reportId: report.id,
  injuries: [{ bodyPart: 'left-leg', type: 'fracture', treatment: 'emergency-room' }]
})

await incidents.collectStatements({
  reportId: report.id,
  witnesses: ['EMP-001', 'EMP-002', 'EMP-003']
})

// File regulatory report
await incidents.fileRegulatoryReport({
  reportId: report.id,
  agency: 'OSHA',
  formType: 'Form-301',
  filedWithin: '24-hours'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert safety leadership on serious incidents
incidents.reportInitialized(async ({ reportId, severity }) => {
  if (severity === 'serious' || severity === 'fatal') {
    await notify({
      to: 'safety-leadership',
      message: `Serious incident reported - immediate investigation required`
    })
  }
})

// Track corrective action completion
incidents.correctiveActionsDefined(async ({ actions }) => {
  for (const action of actions) {
    await scheduleReminder({
      itemId: action.id,
      date: action.dueDate,
      message: `Corrective action "${action.description}" is due`
    })
  }
})
```
