## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { writeOperationalReports } from '@headlessly/write-operational-reports'

const reports = writeOperationalReports()

// Create report outline
const outline = await reports.createOutline({
  title: 'Q1 2026 Warehouse Operations Assessment',
  sections: ['throughput-analysis', 'quality-metrics', 'staffing-observations', 'recommendations'],
  audience: 'operations-leadership'
})

// Write the draft
const draft = await reports.writeDraft({
  outlineId: outline.id,
  narrativeStyle: 'analytical',
  dataRange: { start: '2026-01-01', end: '2026-03-31' }
})

// Formulate recommendations
await reports.formulateRecommendations({
  draftId: draft.id,
  recommendations: [
    { priority: 'high', action: 'Add second shift to loading dock B', rationale: 'Throughput down 15%' },
    { priority: 'medium', action: 'Install automated sorting system', rationale: 'Error rate above threshold' }
  ]
})

// Finalize
await reports.finalizeReport({ draftId: draft.id })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify reviewers when draft is ready
reports.draftWritten(async ({ draftId, title }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'report-review-team',
    message: `Draft ready for review: "${title}"`
  })
})

// Auto-compose executive summary when recommendations are complete
reports.recommendationsFormulated(async ({ draftId }) => {
  await reports.composeExecutiveSummary({ draftId })
})
```
