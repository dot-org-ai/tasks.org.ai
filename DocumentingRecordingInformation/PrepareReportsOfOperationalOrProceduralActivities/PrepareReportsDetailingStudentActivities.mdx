## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { prepareReportsDetailingStudentActivities } from '@headlessly/prepare-reports-detailing-student-activities'

const reports = prepareReportsDetailingStudentActivities()

// Generate a progress report
const progress = await reports.generateProgressReport({
  studentId: 'STU-2026-1234',
  period: 'Q2-2026',
  courses: ['algebra-2', 'english-11', 'chemistry', 'us-history']
})

// Compile report card
const reportCard = await reports.compileReportCard({
  studentId: 'STU-2026-1234',
  term: 'fall-2026',
  includeAttendance: true,
  includeBehavior: true
})

// Distribute to parents
await reports.distributeReports({
  reportIds: [progress.id, reportCard.id],
  recipients: ['parent-portal', 'email'],
  parentEmail: 'parent@email.com.ai'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert counselor on behavioral patterns
reports.behaviorIncidentLogged(async ({ studentId, incidentType, count }) => {
  if (count >= 3) {
    await notify({
      to: 'school-counselor',
      message: `Student ${studentId} has ${count} behavioral incidents this term`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-update transcripts when report cards are finalized
reports.reportCardCompiled(async ({ studentId, term }) => {
  await reports.updateTranscript({ studentId, term })
})
```
