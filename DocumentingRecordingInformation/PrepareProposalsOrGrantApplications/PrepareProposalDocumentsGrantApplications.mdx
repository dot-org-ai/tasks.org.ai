## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { prepareProposalDocumentsGrantApplications } from '@headlessly/prepare-proposal-documents-grant-applications'

const proposals = prepareProposalDocumentsGrantApplications()

// Identify a funding opportunity
const opportunity = await proposals.identifyOpportunity({
  agency: 'National Science Foundation',
  topic: 'Climate Resilience',
  deadlineAfter: '2026-06-01'
})

// Draft a proposal
const proposal = await proposals.draftProposal({
  opportunityId: opportunity.id,
  title: 'Community-Based Climate Adaptation Framework',
  principalInvestigator: 'PI-2045',
  narrative: 'This project proposes a scalable framework for...'
})

// Prepare the budget
await proposals.prepareBudget({
  proposalId: proposal.id,
  totalAmount: 750000,
  duration: { years: 3 },
  lineItems: [
    { category: 'Personnel', amount: 400000 },
    { category: 'Equipment', amount: 150000 },
    { category: 'Travel', amount: 50000 },
    { category: 'Indirect Costs', amount: 150000 }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify team of approaching deadlines
proposals.opportunityIdentified(async ({ opportunityId, deadline }) => {
  const daysUntil = daysUntilDate(deadline)
  if (daysUntil <= 30) {
    await notify({
      to: 'grants-team',
      message: `Funding opportunity ${opportunityId} deadline in ${daysUntil} days`
    })
  }
})

// Trigger revision workflow on feedback
proposals.feedbackReceived(async ({ proposalId, scores, comments }) => {
  if (scores.overall < 80) {
    await proposals.reviseProposal({
      proposalId,
      revisionNotes: comments.join('; ')
    })
  }
})
```
