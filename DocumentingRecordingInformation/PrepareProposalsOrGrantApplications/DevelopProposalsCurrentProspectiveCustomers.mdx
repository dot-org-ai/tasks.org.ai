## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { developProposalsCurrentProspectiveCustomers } from '@headlessly/develop-proposals-current-prospective-customers'

const proposals = developProposalsCurrentProspectiveCustomers()

// Qualify a new opportunity
const opportunity = await proposals.qualifyOpportunity({
  customerName: 'Meridian Healthcare',
  contactEmail: 'procurement@meridian-health.com.ai',
  estimatedValue: 450000,
  expectedCloseDate: '2026-06-30',
  source: 'inbound-request'
})

// Design a solution for the customer
const solution = await proposals.designSolution({
  opportunityId: opportunity.id,
  requirements: ['ehr-integration', 'real-time-analytics', 'hipaa-compliance'],
  deliveryModel: 'managed-service',
  implementationWeeks: 12
})

// Build and present the proposal
const proposal = await proposals.buildProposal({
  opportunityId: opportunity.id,
  solutionId: solution.id,
  includeExecutiveSummary: true,
  pricingTier: 'enterprise',
  validUntil: '2026-05-31'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert sales leadership on high-value wins
proposals.proposalWon(async ({ opportunityId, customerName, contractValue }) => {
  if (contractValue > 250000) {
    await notify({
      to: 'sales-leadership',
      message: `Deal won: ${customerName} - $${contractValue}`
    })
  }
})

// Trigger win/loss analysis on outcome
proposals.proposalLost(async ({ opportunityId, customerName, competitorSelected }) => {
  await proposals.recordOutcome({
    opportunityId,
    result: 'lost',
    competitor: competitorSelected,
    analysisRequired: true
  })
})
```
