## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { prepareProposalsGrantApplicationsObtain } from '@headlessly/prepare-proposals-grant-applications-obtain'

const proposals = prepareProposalsGrantApplicationsObtain()

// Identify a relevant funding opportunity
const opportunity = await proposals.identifyOpportunity({
  agency: 'National Science Foundation',
  topicArea: 'Advanced Manufacturing',
  deadline: { after: '2026-03-01' }
})

// Draft the technical narrative
await proposals.draftNarrative({
  opportunityId: opportunity.id,
  principalInvestigator: 'Dr. Sarah Chen',
  sections: ['projectDescription', 'methodology', 'expectedOutcomes']
})

// Prepare the budget
await proposals.prepareBudget({
  opportunityId: opportunity.id,
  personnel: [{ role: 'PI', months: 3, rate: 15000 }],
  equipment: [{ item: 'Electron Microscope', cost: 250000 }],
  indirectRate: 0.52
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify team when internal review is complete
proposals.internalReviewCompleted(async ({ proposalId, status }) => {
  if (status === 'approved') {
    await notify({
      to: 'grants-office',
      message: `Proposal ${proposalId} cleared for submission`
    })
  }
})

// Track award decisions
proposals.awardDecisionReceived(async ({ proposalId, decision, amount }) => {
  if (decision === 'funded') {
    await notify({
      to: 'principal-investigator',
      message: `Proposal ${proposalId} awarded $${amount.toLocaleString()}`
    })
  }
})
```
