## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { writeGrantProposals } from '@headlessly/write-grant-proposals'

const grants = writeGrantProposals()

// Identify a matching funding opportunity
const opportunity = await grants.identifyOpportunity({
  keywords: ['climate resilience', 'urban infrastructure'],
  agencies: ['nsf', 'epa', 'doe'],
  minAmount: 250000,
  deadlineAfter: '2026-06-01'
})

// Draft the project narrative
const narrative = await grants.draftNarrative({
  opportunityId: opportunity.id,
  sections: ['project-summary', 'significance', 'approach', 'broader-impacts'],
  principalInvestigator: 'dr-martinez',
  maxPages: 15
})

// Prepare the budget
await grants.prepareBudget({
  opportunityId: opportunity.id,
  projectDuration: 36,
  personnel: [
    { role: 'PI', effort: 0.25, annualSalary: 145000 },
    { role: 'Postdoc', effort: 1.0, annualSalary: 60000 }
  ],
  indirectCostRate: 0.55
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert team on approaching deadlines
grants.deadlineApproaching(async ({ opportunityId, agency, deadline, daysRemaining }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'sponsored-programs',
    message: `Grant proposal for ${agency} due in ${daysRemaining} days (${deadline})`
  })
})

// Notify PI on award decision
grants.proposalAwarded(async ({ proposalId, agency, amount, projectStart }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'principal-investigator',
    message: `Congratulations! ${agency} awarded $${amount} starting ${projectStart}`
  })
})
```
