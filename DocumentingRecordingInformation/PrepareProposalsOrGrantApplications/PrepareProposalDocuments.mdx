## Overview

Preparing proposal documents involves analyzing solicitation requirements, developing technical and management approaches, assembling pricing volumes, and producing polished deliverables that respond to requests for proposals, quotes, and information. This definition exposes actions for proposal assembly and compliance verification, events for deadline and review tracking, and searches for proposal metrics and template retrieval.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { prepareProposalDocuments } from '@headlessly/prepare-proposal-documents'

const proposals = prepareProposalDocuments()

// Analyze an incoming RFP
const analysis = await proposals.analyzeSolicitation({
  solicitationId: 'RFP-2026-0042',
  documentUrl: 'https://sam.gov/rfp/2026-0042',
  dueDate: '2026-04-15T17:00:00Z'
})

// Create the proposal outline
const outline = await proposals.createOutline({
  solicitationId: analysis.solicitationId,
  volumes: ['technical', 'management', 'cost', 'past-performance'],
  pageLimit: 100,
  teamAssignments: [
    { section: 'technical-approach', author: 'engineering-lead', pages: 30 },
    { section: 'management-plan', author: 'pm-lead', pages: 20 }
  ]
})

// Run a pink team review
await proposals.conductColorReview({
  proposalId: outline.proposalId,
  reviewType: 'pink-team',
  reviewers: ['capture-manager', 'technical-director', 'contracts-lead']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on submission deadlines
proposals.submissionDeadlineApproaching(async ({ proposalId, client, deadline, daysRemaining }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'proposal-team',
    message: `Proposal for ${client} due in ${daysRemaining} days (${deadline})`
  })
})

// Notify leadership on delivery
proposals.proposalDelivered(async ({ proposalId, client, submissionMethod }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'business-development',
    message: `Proposal ${proposalId} delivered to ${client} via ${submissionMethod}`
  })
})
```
