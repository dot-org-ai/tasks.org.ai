## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { completeDocumentationRequiredProgramsRegulations } from '@headlessly/complete-documentation-required-programs-regulations'

const programs = completeDocumentationRequiredProgramsRegulations()

// Identify requirements for a federal grant
const requirements = await programs.identifyRequirements({
  program: 'HUD-CDBG',
  grantYear: 2026,
  organization: 'City of Springfield'
})

// Complete a required form
await programs.completeForm({
  formId: 'SF-425-Federal-Financial-Report',
  programId: 'HUD-CDBG',
  data: {
    reportingPeriod: 'Q1-2026',
    expenditures: 245000,
    matchingFunds: 61250
  }
})

// Submit documentation
await programs.submitDocumentation({
  programId: 'HUD-CDBG',
  forms: ['SF-425', 'progress-report-Q1'],
  method: 'grants-gov-portal'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert team when deadlines approach
programs.deadlineApproaching(async ({ program, form, daysRemaining }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'program-compliance',
    message: `${form} for ${program} due in ${daysRemaining} days`
  })
})

// Auto-validate when forms are completed
programs.formCompleted(async ({ formId, programId }) => {
  await programs.validateDocumentation({ formId, programId })
})
```
