## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainOrderLegalDocuments } from '@headlessly/maintain-order-legal-documents'

const legalDocs = maintainOrderLegalDocuments()

// Classify and index incoming documents
const classified = await legalDocs.classifyDocument({
  documentId: 'DOC-2026-0451',
  matter: 'Smith v. Acme Corp',
  category: 'correspondence',
  subcategory: 'demand-letter'
})

await legalDocs.assignBatesNumbers({
  matterId: 'CASE-2026-112',
  documents: ['DOC-2026-0451', 'DOC-2026-0452'],
  startNumber: 1001
})

// Retrieve a specific document
const doc = await legalDocs.retrieveDocument({
  batesNumber: 'ACME-001001',
  format: 'pdf'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-index when new documents are classified
legalDocs.documentClassified(async ({ matterId }) => {
  await legalDocs.indexDocuments({ matterId })
})

// Alert records manager when retention expires
legalDocs.fileAuditCompleted(async ({ matterId, expiredCount }) => {
  if (expiredCount > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'records-management',
      message: `${expiredCount} documents in matter ${matterId} have exceeded retention`
    })
  }
})
```
