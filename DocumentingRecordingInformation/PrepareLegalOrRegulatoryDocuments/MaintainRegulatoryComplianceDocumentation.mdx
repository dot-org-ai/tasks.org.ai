## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainRegulatoryComplianceDocumentation } from '@headlessly/maintain-regulatory-compliance-documentation'

const compliance = maintainRegulatoryComplianceDocumentation()

// Catalog a new compliance document
await compliance.catalogDocument({
  title: 'Information Security Policy',
  regulation: 'SOC-2',
  type: 'policy',
  owner: 'ciso@acme-corp.com.ai',
  reviewCycle: '12 months'
})

// Review documents for currency
const review = await compliance.reviewForCurrency({
  regulation: 'SOC-2',
  scope: 'all-policies'
})

// Produce audit package
const auditPkg = await compliance.produceForAudit({
  auditor: 'Deloitte',
  scope: 'SOC-2-Type-II',
  period: { start: '2025-01-01', end: '2025-12-31' }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify policy owners when review is due
compliance.expirationApproaching(async ({ documentId, owner, daysRemaining }) => {
  await notify({
    to: owner,
    message: `Compliance document review due in ${daysRemaining} days`
  })
})

// Trigger reconciliation when regulations change
compliance.regulatoryChangeDetected(async ({ regulation, changeType }) => {
  const affected = await compliance.findByRegulation({ regulation })
  for (const doc of affected) {
    await compliance.reconcileChanges({ documentId: doc.id, changeType })
  }
})
```
