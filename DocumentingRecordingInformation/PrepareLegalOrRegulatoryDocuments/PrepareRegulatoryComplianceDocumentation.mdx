## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { prepareRegulatoryComplianceDocumentation } from '@headlessly/prepare-regulatory-compliance-documentation'

const regDocs = prepareRegulatoryComplianceDocumentation()

// Analyze regulatory requirements
const requirements = await regDocs.analyzeRequirements({
  regulation: 'GDPR',
  jurisdiction: 'EU',
  applicableArticles: ['Art. 30', 'Art. 35', 'Art. 37']
})

// Draft a data protection policy
const policy = await regDocs.draftPolicy({
  title: 'Data Protection and Privacy Policy',
  regulation: 'GDPR',
  requirements: requirements.ids,
  department: 'organization-wide'
})

// Assemble and submit filing
const filing = await regDocs.assembleFilingPackage({
  authority: 'EU-DPA',
  filingType: 'data-protection-impact-assessment',
  documents: [policy.id, 'processing-records', 'dpia-report']
})

await regDocs.submitFiling({ packageId: filing.id })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify when new regulatory requirements are analyzed
regDocs.requirementsAnalyzed(async ({ regulation, requirementCount }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'compliance-team',
    message: `${requirementCount} requirements identified for ${regulation} - policy drafting needed`
  })
})

// Auto-validate when filing package is assembled
regDocs.filingPackageAssembled(async ({ packageId }) => {
  await regDocs.validateDocumentation({ packageId })
})
```
