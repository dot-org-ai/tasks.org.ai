## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { prepareReportsRelatedComplianceMatters } from '@headlessly/prepare-reports-related-compliance-matters'

const compliance = prepareReportsRelatedComplianceMatters()

// Gather compliance data for quarterly report
const data = await compliance.gatherComplianceData({
  regulation: 'HIPAA',
  period: { start: '2026-01-01', end: '2026-03-31' },
  departments: ['clinical-operations', 'information-technology']
})

// Analyze and draft
const findings = await compliance.analyzeFindings({ datasetId: data.id })
const report = await compliance.draftReport({
  title: 'Q1 2026 HIPAA Compliance Report',
  findings: findings.items,
  regulation: 'HIPAA'
})

// Submit to regulator
await compliance.submitReport({
  reportId: report.id,
  recipient: 'HHS-OCR',
  method: 'electronic-filing'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Escalate high-severity findings
compliance.findingsAnalyzed(async ({ findings }) => {
  const critical = findings.filter(f => f.severity === 'critical')
  if (critical.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'compliance-leadership',
      message: `${critical.length} critical compliance findings require immediate attention`
    })
  }
})

// Track remediation deadlines
compliance.correctiveActionsDocumented(async ({ actions }) => {
  for (const action of actions) {
    await scheduleReminder({
      itemId: action.id,
      date: action.dueDate,
      message: `Corrective action "${action.title}" is due`
    })
  }
})
```
