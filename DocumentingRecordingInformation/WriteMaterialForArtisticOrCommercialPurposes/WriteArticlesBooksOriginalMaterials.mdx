```typescript
import { writeArticlesBooksOriginalMaterials } from '@headlessly/write-articles-books-original-materials'

const writing = writeArticlesBooksOriginalMaterials()

// Research and outline a new book
const research = await writing.conductResearch({
  topic: 'Machine Learning in Supply Chain Optimization',
