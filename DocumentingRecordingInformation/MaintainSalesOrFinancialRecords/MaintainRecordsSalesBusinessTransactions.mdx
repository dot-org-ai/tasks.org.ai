## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainRecordsSalesBusinessTransactions } from '@headlessly/maintain-records-sales-business-transactions'

const transactions = maintainRecordsSalesBusinessTransactions()

// Record a completed sales transaction
const txn = await transactions.recordTransaction({
  type: 'sale',
  customerId: 'CUST-8834',
  orderId: 'SO-2026-04221',
  amount: 12500.00,
  paymentMethod: 'net-30',
  date: '2026-02-04'
})

// Reconcile transactions for the month
const reconciliation = await transactions.reconcileTransactions({
  period: { start: '2026-01-01', end: '2026-01-31' },
  matchCriteria: ['payment-received', 'delivery-confirmed']
})

// Generate a monthly transaction report
const report = await transactions.generateTransactionReport({
  type: 'revenue-summary',
  period: { start: '2026-01-01', end: '2026-01-31' },
  groupBy: 'customer'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert accounting when reconciliation mismatches are found
transactions.reconciliationMismatchFound(async ({ transactionId, expectedAmount, actualAmount }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'accounting-team',
    message: `Mismatch on transaction ${transactionId}: expected $${expectedAmount}, received $${actualAmount}`
  })
})

// Auto-archive records after period-end reports are generated
transactions.transactionReportGenerated(async ({ period }) => {
  await transactions.archiveTransactionRecords({
    olderThan: period.start,
    retentionPolicy: '7-years'
  })
})
```
