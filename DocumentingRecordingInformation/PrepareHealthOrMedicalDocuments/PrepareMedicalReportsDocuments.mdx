## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { prepareMedicalReportsDocuments } from '@headlessly/prepare-medical-reports-documents'

const medReports = prepareMedicalReportsDocuments()

// Draft an operative note
const report = await medReports.draftReport({
  type: 'operative-note',
  patientId: 'PAT-30042',
  physicianId: 'DR-1187',
  procedure: 'Laparoscopic cholecystectomy',
  findings: 'Gallbladder with multiple calculi, no evidence of perforation',
  complications: 'none',
  date: '2026-02-03'
})

// Assign diagnostic codes
await medReports.assignDiagnosticCodes({
  reportId: report.id,
  codes: [
    { type: 'ICD-10', code: 'K80.20', description: 'Calculus of gallbladder without obstruction' },
    { type: 'CPT', code: '47562', description: 'Laparoscopic cholecystectomy' }
  ]
})

// Distribute the signed report
await medReports.distributeReport({
  reportId: report.id,
  recipients: [
    { type: 'referring-provider', id: 'DR-0892' },
    { type: 'insurance', id: 'INS-BCBS-4401' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify transcription queue when dictation is available
medReports.reportDrafted(async ({ reportId, type }) => {
  if (type === 'dictation-pending') {
    await addToTranscriptionQueue({ reportId })
  }
})

// Alert physician about unsigned reports nearing deadline
medReports.reportReviewed(async ({ reportId, physicianId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: physicianId,
    message: `Report ${reportId} is reviewed and awaiting your signature`
  })
})
```
