## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { prepareOfficialHealthDocumentsRecords } from '@headlessly/prepare-official-health-documents-records'

const healthDocs = prepareOfficialHealthDocumentsRecords()

// Create a birth certificate
const birthCert = await healthDocs.createDocument({
  type: 'birth-certificate',
  patientId: 'NEWBORN-2026-0204',
  data: {
    dateOfBirth: '2026-02-04',
    placeOfBirth: 'Memorial General Hospital',
    motherName: 'Sarah Chen',
    fatherName: 'David Chen',
    attendingPhysician: 'DR-0553'
  }
})

// Certify the document
await healthDocs.certifyDocument({
  documentId: birthCert.id,
  certifierId: 'DR-0553',
  attestation: 'I hereby certify the above information is true and correct'
})

// File with the vital records office
await healthDocs.fileWithRegistry({
  documentId: birthCert.id,
  registry: 'state-vital-records',

})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-submit communicable disease reports upon certification
healthDocs.documentCertified(async ({ documentId, type }) => {
  if (type === 'communicable-disease-report') {
    await healthDocs.reportCommunicableDisease({ documentId })
  }
})

// Notify registrar of pending filings approaching deadline
healthDocs.documentCreated(async ({ documentId, type, createdAt }) => {
  const deadline = getFilingDeadline(type, createdAt)
  await scheduleReminder({
    to: 'registrar',
    message: `Document ${documentId} must be filed by ${deadline}`,
    remindAt: subtractDays(deadline, 2)
  })
})
```
