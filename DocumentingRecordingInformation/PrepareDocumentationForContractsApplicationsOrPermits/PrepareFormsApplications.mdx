## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { prepareFormsApplications } from '@headlessly/prepare-forms-applications'

const forms = prepareFormsApplications()

// Select and populate a form
const form = await forms.selectForm({
  templateId: 'business-license-application',
  jurisdiction: 'US-TX-Houston'
})

await forms.populateFields({
  formId: form.id,
  fields: {
    businessName: 'Summit Consulting Group',
    ein: '82-1234567',
    businessType: 'Professional Services',
    address: '500 Main Street, Houston, TX 77002'
  }
})

// Validate and submit
const validation = await forms.validateForm({ formId: form.id })
if (validation.isValid) {
  await forms.submitForm({ formId: form.id })
}
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert preparer when corrections are requested
forms.correctionRequested(async ({ formId, issues }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'form-preparers',
    message: `Corrections needed for form ${formId}: ${issues.length} items`
  })
})

// Auto-validate after fields are populated
forms.fieldsPopulated(async ({ formId }) => {
  await forms.validateForm({ formId })
})
```
