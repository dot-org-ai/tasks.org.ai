## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { prepareDocumentationPermitsLicenses } from '@headlessly/prepare-documentation-permits-licenses'

const permits = prepareDocumentationPermitsLicenses()

// Research requirements for a building permit
const requirements = await permits.researchRequirements({
  permitType: 'commercial-building',
  jurisdiction: 'US-CA-LA',
  projectScope: 'new-construction'
})

// Initialize and assemble the application
const application = await permits.initializeApplication({
  type: 'commercial-building-permit',
  applicant: { name: 'Vertex Development LLC' },
  project: { address: '1200 Commerce Blvd', parcel: 'APN-4455-001' }
})

await permits.assembleDocuments({
  applicationId: application.id,
  documents: ['site-plan', 'structural-drawings', 'environmental-review']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert team when deficiency notice is received
permits.deficiencyNotified(async ({ applicationId, items }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'permit-team',
    message: `Deficiency notice received for application ${applicationId}: ${items.length} items`
  })
})

// Auto-schedule renewal reminders
permits.permitApproved(async ({ permitId, expirationDate }) => {
  await permits.scheduleRenewal({
    permitId,
    reminderDays: [180, 90, 30]
  })
})
```
