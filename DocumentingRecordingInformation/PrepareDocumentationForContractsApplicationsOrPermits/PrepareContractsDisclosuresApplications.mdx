## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { prepareContractsDisclosuresApplications } from '@headlessly/prepare-contracts-disclosures-applications'

const docs = prepareContractsDisclosuresApplications()

// Initiate a mortgage application
const application = await docs.initiateApplication({
  type: 'residential-mortgage',
  borrower: { name: 'Jane Doe', ssn: '***-**-1234' },
  property: { address: '742 Evergreen Terrace', apn: 'R-12345' }
})

// Generate required disclosures
await docs.generateDisclosures({
  applicationId: application.id,
  disclosureTypes: ['truth-in-lending', 'closing-disclosure', 'good-faith-estimate']
})

// Compile and deliver
const pkg = await docs.compilePackage({ applicationId: application.id })
await docs.deliverDocuments({ packageId: pkg.id, method: 'secure-portal' })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Trigger compliance review when package is compiled
docs.packageCompiled(async ({ packageId }) => {
  await docs.reviewForCompliance({ packageId })
})

// Notify closing coordinator when documents are signed
docs.documentsExecuted(async ({ packageId, transactionType }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'closing-team',
    message: `All documents executed for ${transactionType} - ready for funding`
  })
})
```
