## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { prepareSalesContracts } from '@headlessly/prepare-sales-contracts'

const contracts = prepareSalesContracts()

// Draft a new sales contract
const contract = await contracts.draftContract({
  templateId: 'enterprise-saas-agreement',
  customer: { name: 'Acme Corp', jurisdiction: 'US-DE' },
  terms: {
    value: 250000,
    currency: 'USD',
    duration: '24 months',
    paymentTerms: 'net-30'
  }
})

// Submit for review
await contracts.submitForReview({
  contractId: contract.id,
  reviewers: ['legal-team', 'finance-team']
})

// Execute after approval
await contracts.executeContract({
  contractId: contract.id,
  signers: ['sales-vp@company.com', 'cfo@acmecorp.com']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert sales team on approaching expirations
contracts.contractExpiring(async ({ contractId, customer, daysRemaining }) => {
  if (daysRemaining <= 90) {
    await notify({
      to: 'sales-team',
      message: `Contract with ${customer.name} expires in ${daysRemaining} days`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-archive executed contracts
contracts.contractExecuted(async ({ contractId }) => {
  await archiveDocument({ documentId: contractId, repository: 'executed-contracts' })
})
```
