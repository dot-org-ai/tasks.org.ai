## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { prepareDocumentationContractsTransactionsRegulatory } from '@headlessly/prepare-documentation-contracts-transactions-regulatory'

const docs = prepareDocumentationContractsTransactionsRegulatory()

// Identify documentation requirements
const requirements = await docs.identifyRequirements({
  transactionType: 'vendor-agreement',
  jurisdiction: 'US-NY',
  regulatoryFramework: 'SOX'
})

// Draft and assemble
const contract = await docs.draftDocument({
  template: 'master-service-agreement',
  counterparty: { name: 'Global Services Inc' },
  terms: { value: 500000, duration: '12 months' }
})

const pkg = await docs.assemblePackage({
  documents: [contract.id],
  attachments: ['certificate-of-insurance', 'w9-form']
})

// Submit regulatory filing
await docs.submitFiling({
  packageId: pkg.id,
  authority: 'SEC',
  filingType: 'material-contract-disclosure'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert compliance team on approaching deadlines
docs.deadlineApproaching(async ({ filingType, dueDate, daysRemaining }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'compliance-team',
    message: `${filingType} filing due in ${daysRemaining} days (${dueDate})`
  })
})

// Auto-archive after filing confirmation
docs.filingSubmitted(async ({ packageId, authority }) => {
  await docs.archiveDocuments({
    packageId,
    retentionPolicy: 'regulatory-7-year'
  })
})
```
