## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { documentInformationRelatedLegalProceedings } from '@headlessly/document-information-related-legal-proceedings'

const caseDocuments = documentInformationRelatedLegalProceedings()

// Catalog an exhibit
const exhibit = await caseDocuments.catalogExhibit({
  caseId: 'CASE-2026-00142',
  title: 'Email correspondence re: contract terms',
  type: 'electronic',
  classification: 'documentary-evidence',
  dateReceived: '2026-01-20'
})

// Maintain chain of custody
await caseDocuments.maintainChainOfCustody({
  evidenceId: exhibit.id,
  action: 'transfer',
  fromCustodian: 'Sarah Johnson',
  toCustodian: 'Evidence Room B',
  timestamp: '2026-01-21T09:00:00Z'
})

// Produce documents in response to discovery
await caseDocuments.produceDocuments({
  caseId: 'CASE-2026-00142',
  requestId: 'RFP-003',
  documents: [exhibit.id],
  recipient: 'opposing-counsel@firm.com',
  format: 'native'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Log all custody changes for audit trail
caseDocuments.chainOfCustodyUpdated(async ({ evidenceId, action, timestamp }) => {
  await auditLog.record({
    entity: 'evidence',
    entityId: evidenceId,
    event: `custody-${action}`,
    timestamp
  })
})

// Notify team when document production is complete
caseDocuments.documentsProduced(async ({ caseId, requestId, documentCount }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'litigation-team',
    message: `${documentCount} documents produced for ${requestId} in case ${caseId}`
  })
})
```
