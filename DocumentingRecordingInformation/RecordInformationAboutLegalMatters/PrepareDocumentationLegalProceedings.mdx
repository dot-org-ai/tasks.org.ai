```typescript
import { prepareDocumentationLegalProceedings } from '@headlessly/prepare-documentation-legal-proceedings'

const proceedingDocs = prepareDocumentationLegalProceedings()

// Transcribe a court hearing
const transcript = await proceedingDocs.transcribeProceeding({
  caseId: 'CASE-2026-00218',
  hearingDate: '2026-01-28',
  proceedingType: 'evidentiary-hearing',
  audioSource: 'courtroom-recording-20260128.wav',

proceedingDocs.proceedingTranscribed(async ({ caseId, hearingDate, transcriptId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'case-attorneys',
    message: `Transcript for ${hearingDate} hearing in case ${caseId} is now available`
  })
})

// Auto-assemble appellate record when appeal is filed
proceedingDocs.recordCertified(async ({ caseId, hasAppeal }) => {
  if (hasAppeal) {
    await proceedingDocs.assembleAppellateRecord({
      caseId,
      designation: 'full-record'
