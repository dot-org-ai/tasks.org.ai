## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { recordInformationLegalProceedings } from '@headlessly/record-information-legal-proceedings'

const proceedingRecords = recordInformationLegalProceedings()

// Start recording a hearing session
const session = await proceedingRecords.startRecording({
  caseId: 'CASE-2026-00456',
  proceedingType: 'jury-trial',
  courtroom: 'Room 4B',
  startTime: '2026-02-05T09:00:00Z',
  method: 'stenographic-and-audio'
})

// Annotate a procedural event
await proceedingRecords.annotateEvent({
  sessionId: session.id,
  timestamp: '2026-02-05T10:22:15Z',
  type: 'objection',
  speaker: 'Defense Counsel',
  ruling: 'sustained',
  context: 'Objection to hearsay testimony from Witness #3'
})

// Certify the completed transcript
await proceedingRecords.certifyTranscript({
  sessionId: session.id,
  certifiedBy: 'CSR Patricia Morales, RPR',
  certificationDate: '2026-02-07'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify attorneys when certified transcript is available
proceedingRecords.transcriptCertified(async ({ caseId, sessionId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'case-attorneys',
    message: `Certified transcript for session ${sessionId} in case ${caseId} is now available for download`
  })
})

// Auto-start real-time feed when recording begins
proceedingRecords.recordingStarted(async ({ sessionId, caseId }) => {
  await proceedingRecords.produceRealTimeFeed({
    sessionId,
    recipients: ['judge-bench', 'counsel-table-plaintiff', 'counsel-table-defense']
  })
})
```
