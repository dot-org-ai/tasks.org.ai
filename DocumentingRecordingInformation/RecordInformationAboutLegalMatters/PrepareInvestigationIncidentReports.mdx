## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { prepareInvestigationIncidentReports } from '@headlessly/prepare-investigation-incident-reports'

const reports = prepareInvestigationIncidentReports()

// Initiate a new incident report
const report = await reports.initiateReport({
  type: 'workplace-injury',
  severity: 'serious',
  location: 'Warehouse B, Loading Dock 3',
  occurredAt: '2026-02-04T14:30:00Z',
  description: 'Forklift operator struck shelving unit causing material to fall'
})

// Conduct a witness interview
await reports.conductInterview({
  reportId: report.id,
  witness: { name: 'Maria Garcia', role: 'Shift Supervisor' },
  statement: 'I observed the forklift turning too sharply around the corner of aisle 7',
  interviewDate: '2026-02-04T16:00:00Z'
})

// Analyze root cause
await reports.analyzeRootCause({
  reportId: report.id,
  method: 'five-whys',
  findings: [
    'Aisle width below minimum standard for forklift operation',
    'Operator had not completed refresher training in 18 months'
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify safety team on serious incidents
reports.reportInitiated(async ({ reportId, severity, type }) => {
  if (severity === 'serious' || severity === 'fatal') {
    await notify({
      to: 'safety-officer',
      priority: 'urgent',
      message: `${severity} ${type} incident reported: ${reportId}`
    })
  }
})

// File regulatory reports upon approval
reports.reportApproved(async ({ reportId, type, severity }) => {
  if (severity === 'serious') {
    await submitToAgency({
      agency: 'OSHA',
      reportId,
      deadline: '8-hours'
    })
  }
})
```
