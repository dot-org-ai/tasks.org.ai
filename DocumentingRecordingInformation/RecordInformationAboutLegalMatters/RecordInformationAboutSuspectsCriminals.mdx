## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { recordInformationAboutSuspectsCriminals } from '@headlessly/record-information-about-suspects-criminals'

const suspectRecords = recordInformationAboutSuspectsCriminals()

// Create a new suspect profile
const suspect = await suspectRecords.createSuspectProfile({
  lastName: 'Doe',
  firstName: 'John',
  dateOfBirth: '1985-07-12',
  physicalDescription: {
    height: '5-11',
    weight: 180,
    eyeColor: 'brown',
    hairColor: 'black',
    distinguishingMarks: 'Scar on left forearm'
  }
})

// Record biometric data
await suspectRecords.recordBiometrics({
  suspectId: suspect.id,
  type: 'fingerprint',
  capturedBy: 'Officer Davis',
  capturedAt: '2026-02-05T09:30:00Z'
})

// Link suspect to an active case
await suspectRecords.linkToCase({
  suspectId: suspect.id,
  caseId: 'INV-2026-04521',
  role: 'primary-suspect',
  linkedBy: 'Det. Thompson'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify investigators when suspect is linked to new case
suspectRecords.suspectLinkedToCase(async ({ suspectId, caseId }) => {
  const history = await suspectRecords.getCriminalHistory({ suspectId })
  if (history.priorConvictions > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'lead-detective',
      message: `Suspect ${suspectId} linked to ${caseId} - has ${history.priorConvictions} prior convictions`
    })
  }
})

// Cross-reference biometrics against federal databases
suspectRecords.biometricsRecorded(async ({ suspectId, type }) => {
  if (type === 'fingerprint') {
    await submitToDatabase({
      database: 'AFIS',
      suspectId,
      searchType: 'tenprint-match'
    })
  }
})
```
