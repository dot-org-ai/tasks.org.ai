## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { recordInformationAboutLegalMatters } from '@headlessly/record-information-about-legal-matters'

const legalRecords = recordInformationAboutLegalMatters()

// Open a new legal matter
const matter = await legalRecords.createMatter({
  title: 'Smith v. Acme Corp - Product Liability',
  type: 'litigation',
  jurisdiction: 'US-CA',
  parties: [
    { name: 'John Smith', role: 'plaintiff' },
    { name: 'Acme Corp', role: 'defendant' }
  ]
})

// Record a document
await legalRecords.recordDocument({
  matterId: matter.id,
  title: 'Initial Complaint',
  classification: 'pleading',
  filedDate: '2026-01-15'
})

// Set a discovery deadline
await legalRecords.setDeadline({
  matterId: matter.id,
  description: 'Discovery cutoff',
  dueDate: '2026-06-30',
  reminderDays: [30, 14, 7]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on approaching deadlines
legalRecords.deadlineApproaching(async ({ matterId, description, dueDate, daysRemaining }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'legal-team',
    message: `Deadline "${description}" for matter ${matterId} due in ${daysRemaining} days`
  })
})

// Auto-apply retention policy on matter closure
legalRecords.matterClosed(async ({ matterId, type }) => {
  await legalRecords.applyRetentionPolicy({
    matterId,
    policy: type === 'litigation' ? '7-year-hold' : '3-year-standard'
  })
})
```
