## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { modifyTeachingMethodsMaterialsAccommodate } from '@headlessly/modify-teaching-methods-materials-accommodate'

const accommodations = modifyTeachingMethodsMaterialsAccommodate()

// Assess accommodation needs
const assessment = await accommodations.assessAccommodationNeeds({
  studentId: 'STU-2026-1847',
  courseId: 'ENG-101',
  assessmentType: 'learning-style-evaluation',
  identifiedNeeds: ['visual-impairment', 'extended-time']
})

// Create accommodation plan
const plan = await accommodations.createAccommodationPlan({
  studentId: 'STU-2026-1847',
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  modifications: [
    { type: 'material-format', detail: 'large-print-and-audio' },
    { type: 'assessment-timing', detail: 'time-and-a-half' }
  ]
})

// Modify instructional material
await accommodations.modifyInstructionalMaterial({
  materialId: 'MAT-ENG101-CH03',
  planId: plan.id,
  adaptations: ['large-print', 'audio-narration', 'high-contrast']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-modify materials when plan is created
accommodations.accommodationPlanCreated(async ({ planId, modifications }) => {
  for (const mod of modifications) {
    if (mod.type === 'material-format') {
      await accommodations.modifyInstructionalMaterial({
        planId,
        adaptations: [mod.detail]
      })
    }
  }
})

// Schedule effectiveness review after implementation
accommodations.instructionalMaterialModified(async ({ planId, materialId }) => {
  await scheduleTask({
    action: 'reviewAccommodationEffectiveness',
    planId,
    scheduledDate: addWeeks(new Date(), 4)
  })
})
```
