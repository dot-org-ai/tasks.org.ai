# Prepare Instruction Manuals

> Business-as-Code definition for instruction manual preparation. Models the complete lifecycle of creating, reviewing, and publishing technical manuals and user guides.

## Overview

Instruction manual preparation encompasses the authoring, formatting, reviewing, and distributing of technical documentation that guides end users through product operation, maintenance, and troubleshooting. This definition exposes actions for each phase of the documentation workflow, events for tracking progress and triggering reviews, and searches for retrieving manuals by product, version, or audience.

## Actors

| Actor | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| SubjectMatterExpert | Provides technical knowledge and validates accuracy of instructions |
| ProductEngineer | Supplies product specifications and functional details |
| EndUser | Consumes the finished manual and provides usability feedback |
| TranslationVendor | Localizes manuals for international markets |
| PrintVendor | Handles physical printing and binding of manuals |
| RegulatoryBody | Requires specific safety disclosures and compliance language |

## Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| TechnicalWriter | Authors and structures manual content |
| DocumentationManager | Oversees the manual production schedule and quality |
| Editor | Reviews content for clarity, grammar, and consistency |

| approveManual | Formally approve the manual for publication |
| publishManual | Release the manual to distribution channels |
| reviseManual | Create a new revision of an existing manual |
| archiveManual | Move a deprecated manual to long-term storage |

## Events

| Event | Description |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { prepareInstructionManuals } from '@headlessly/prepare-instruction-manuals'

const manuals = prepareInstructionManuals()

// Create a new product manual
const manual = await manuals.createManual({
  product: 'Industrial Pump Model X200',
  version: '3.1',
  audience: 'field-technician',
  language: 'en-US'
})

// Draft a section
await manuals.draftSection({
  manualId: manual.id,
  title: 'Installation Procedures',
  content: 'Step-by-step installation guide...',
  order: 2
})

// Publish after approval
await manuals.publishManual({
  manualId: manual.id,
  channels: ['web', 'print', 'pdf']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify reviewers when a section is drafted
manuals.sectionDrafted(async ({ manualId, sectionId, author }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'technical-review-team',
    message: `New section ready for review in manual ${manualId}`
  })
})

// Trigger localization when manual is approved
manuals.manualApproved(async ({ manualId, version }) => {
  await manuals.publishManual({
    manualId,
    channels: ['translation-queue']
  })
})
```
