## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { developInstructionalMaterials } from '@headlessly/develop-instructional-materials'

const materials = developInstructionalMaterials()

// Analyze learning needs
const analysis = await materials.analyzeLearningNeeds({
  audience: 'new-hire-engineers',
  domain: 'safety-procedures',
  currentProficiency: 'beginner'
})

// Design the curriculum
const curriculum = await materials.designCurriculum({
  title: 'Workplace Safety Fundamentals',
  objectives: analysis.gaps,
  duration: '8 hours',
  format: 'blended'
})

// Create a module
await materials.createModule({
  curriculumId: curriculum.id,
  title: 'Hazard Identification',
  content: 'Module content...',
  order: 1
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-publish when all modules pass review
materials.materialsReviewed(async ({ curriculumId }) => {
  const modules = await materials.getModules({ curriculumId })
  const allApproved = modules.every(m => m.status === 'approved')
  if (allApproved) {
    await materials.publishMaterials({ curriculumId })
  }
})

// Notify SMEs when new content needs review
materials.moduleCreated(async ({ moduleId, topic }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'subject-matter-experts',
    message: `New module on ${topic} ready for technical review`
  })
})
```
