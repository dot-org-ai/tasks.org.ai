# Create Technology-based Learning Materials

> Business-as-Code definition for creating technology-based learning materials. Models the design, development, review, and publishing of e-learning courses, interactive modules, multimedia content, and digital assessments for educational and corporate training programs.

## Overview

Creating technology-based learning materials involves designing and developing digital instructional content such as e-learning modules, interactive simulations, video tutorials, and online assessments using learning management systems and authoring tools. This process spans needs analysis, instructional design, content authoring, multimedia production, accessibility compliance, and deployment to learning platforms. Effective digital learning materials support scalable workforce training, academic instruction, and professional development programs.

## Actors

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { createTechnologyBasedLearningMaterials } from '@headlessly/create-technology-based-learning-materials'

const learning = createTechnologyBasedLearningMaterials()

// Design a new training curriculum
const curriculum = await learning.designCurriculum({
  title: 'Cybersecurity Fundamentals',
  audience: 'all-employees',
  objectives: [
    'Identify common phishing techniques',
    'Apply password management best practices',
    'Report security incidents through proper channels'
  ],
  estimatedDuration: '2 hours'
})

// Author a module within the curriculum
const module = await learning.authorModule({
  curriculumId: curriculum.id,
  title: 'Recognizing Phishing Attacks',
  format: 'interactive-scenario',
  content: {
    sections: ['Introduction', 'Real-World Examples', 'Interactive Practice', 'Summary'],
    interactionType: 'branching-scenario'
  }
})

// Package and publish the completed course
const coursePackage = await learning.packageCourse({
  curriculumId: curriculum.id,
  standard: 'SCORM-2004',
  includeAssessments: true
})

await learning.publishToLMS({
  packageId: coursePackage.id,
  lmsTarget: 'corporate-lms',
  availableFrom: '2026-03-01',
  mandatory: true
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify stakeholders when a course is published
learning.coursePublished(async ({ curriculumId, title, lmsTarget }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'training-stakeholders',
    message: `Course "${title}" has been published to ${lmsTarget}`
  })
})

// Auto-assign reviewers when content is authored
learning.moduleAuthored(async ({ moduleId, title }) => {
  await assignReview({
    contentId: moduleId,
    reviewers: ['sme-reviewer', 'accessibility-reviewer'],
    deadline: addDays(new Date(), 5)
  })
})
```
