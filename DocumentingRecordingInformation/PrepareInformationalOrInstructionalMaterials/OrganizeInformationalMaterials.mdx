## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { organizeInformationalMaterials } from '@headlessly/organize-informational-materials'

const materials = organizeInformationalMaterials()

// Classify a new material
const classified = await materials.classifyMaterial({
  materialId: 'DOC-2026-0891',
  title: 'Employee Onboarding Handbook',
  categories: ['human-resources', 'onboarding', 'policy'],
  audience: 'new-hires',
  format: 'pdf'
})

// Structure a collection of related materials
await materials.structureCollection({
  collectionName: 'New Employee Resources',
  materialIds: ['DOC-2026-0891', 'DOC-2026-0892', 'DOC-2026-0893'],
  ordering: 'sequential'
})

// Bundle for distribution
await materials.bundleForDistribution({
  collectionId: 'new-employee-resources',
  channel: 'intranet-portal',
  format: 'html'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-index when materials are classified
materials.materialClassified(async ({ materialId, categories }) => {
  await materials.indexMaterials({ materialIds: [materialId] })
})

// Notify reviewers when collection is structured
materials.collectionStructured(async ({ collectionId, collectionName }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'content-review-team',
    message: `Collection "${collectionName}" is ready for review`
  })
})
```
