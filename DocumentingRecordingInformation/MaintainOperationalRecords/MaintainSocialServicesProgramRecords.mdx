## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainSocialServicesProgramRecords } from '@headlessly/maintain-social-services-program-records'

const records = maintainSocialServicesProgramRecords()

// Create a new case file for an enrolled client
const caseFile = await records.createCaseFile({
  clientId: 'CLT-2026-04821',
  program: 'Supplemental Nutrition Assistance',
  intakeDate: '2026-01-15',
  eligibilityStatus: 'approved'
})

// Log a service delivery encounter
await records.recordServiceDelivery({
  caseFileId: caseFile.id,
  serviceType: 'benefit-disbursement',
  date: '2026-02-01',
  notes: 'Monthly SNAP benefits issued to household'
})

// Generate a compliance report for audit
const report = await records.generateComplianceReport({
  program: 'Supplemental Nutrition Assistance',
  period: { start: '2026-01-01', end: '2026-03-31' }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify compliance officer when retention period expires
records.retentionPeriodExpired(async ({ caseFileId, program }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'compliance-team',
    message: `Case file ${caseFileId} in ${program} has reached retention end date`
  })
})

// Automatically generate compliance reports after eligibility updates
records.eligibilityUpdated(async ({ caseFileId, newStatus }) => {
  if (newStatus === 'denied') {
    await records.generateComplianceReport({ caseFileId })
  }
})
```
