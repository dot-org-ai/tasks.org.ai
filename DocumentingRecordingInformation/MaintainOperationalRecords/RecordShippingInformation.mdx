## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { recordShippingInformation } from '@headlessly/record-shipping-information'

const shipping = recordShippingInformation()

// Create a new shipment
const shipment = await shipping.createShipment({
  origin: { warehouse: 'east-dc-01', city: 'Newark', state: 'NJ' },
  destination: { company: 'Midwest Parts Inc', city: 'Chicago', state: 'IL' },
  orderReference: 'SO-2026-04421',
  priority: 'standard'
})

// Record package details
await shipping.recordPackageDetails({
  shipmentId: shipment.id,
  packages: [
    { weight: 45.2, dimensions: { l: 24, w: 18, h: 12 }, contents: 'Precision bearings', hazmat: false },
    { weight: 12.8, dimensions: { l: 14, w: 10, h: 8 }, contents: 'Mounting hardware', hazmat: false }
  ]
})

// Assign carrier and capture tracking
await shipping.assignCarrier({
  shipmentId: shipment.id,
  carrier: 'fedex-freight',
  serviceLevel: 'economy',
  estimatedDelivery: '2026-02-10'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on shipment exceptions
shipping.shipmentException(async ({ shipmentId, type, description, carrier }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'logistics-team',
    message: `Shipment ${shipmentId} via ${carrier}: ${type} - ${description}`
  })
})

// Auto-close orders on delivery confirmation
shipping.deliveryConfirmed(async ({ shipmentId, orderReference, deliveredAt }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'order-fulfillment',
    message: `Order ${orderReference} delivered at ${deliveredAt}`
  })
})
```
