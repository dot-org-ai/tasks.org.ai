```typescript
import { maintainPersonnelRecords } from '@headlessly/maintain-personnel-records'

const personnel = maintainPersonnelRecords()

// Create a new employee file
const file = await personnel.createEmployeeFile({
  employeeId: 'EMP-2026-0384',
  name: 'Maria Gonzalez',
  department: 'engineering',
  startDate: '2026-02-10',
  role: 'Senior Software Engineer'

// File onboarding documents
await personnel.fileDocument({
  employeeId: file.employeeId,
  documentType: 'i9-verification',
  document: 'onboarding/gonzalez-i9-signed.pdf',
  expirationDate: null
})

// Verify compliance for new hire
await personnel.verifyCompliance({
  employeeId: file.employeeId,
  checklist: 'new-hire-onboarding',
  requiredDocuments: ['i9', 'w4', 'direct-deposit', 'handbook-acknowledgment']

```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert HR on expiring certifications
personnel.certificationExpiring(async ({ employeeId, certification, expirationDate, daysRemaining }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'hr-records',
    message: `${certification} for employee ${employeeId} expires in ${daysRemaining} days (${expirationDate})`
  })
})

// Flag compliance gaps
personnel.complianceGapDetected(async ({ employeeId, missingDocuments }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'hr-compliance',
    message: `Employee ${employeeId} missing: ${missingDocuments.join(', ')}`
  })
})
```
