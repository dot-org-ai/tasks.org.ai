## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainOperationalRecords } from '@headlessly/maintain-operational-records'

const records = maintainOperationalRecords()

// Create a new operational record
const record = await records.createRecord({
  type: 'incident-report',
  department: 'manufacturing',
  title: 'Equipment malfunction - Line 3',
  description: 'Conveyor belt tension failure at 14:30, production halted for 45 minutes',
  severity: 'medium',
  date: '2026-02-05'
})

// Classify and apply retention
await records.classifyRecord({
  recordId: record.id,
  category: 'safety-incident',
  retentionSchedule: 'osha-5-year'
})

// Retrieve records for an audit
const auditRecords = await records.findRecords({
  category: 'safety-incident',
  dateRange: { start: '2025-01-01', end: '2025-12-31' },
  department: 'manufacturing'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert compliance team on policy violations
records.complianceViolationDetected(async ({ recordId, violation, department }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'compliance-team',
    message: `Records violation in ${department}: ${violation} (Record: ${recordId})`
  })
})

// Notify records manager before retention expires
records.retentionExpiring(async ({ recordId, category, expirationDate, daysRemaining }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'records-manager',
    message: `Record ${recordId} (${category}) retention expires in ${daysRemaining} days`
  })
})
```
