# Document Work Hours or Activities

> Business-as-Code definition for work hours and activity documentation. Models the lifecycle from time entry through approval, overtime calculation, project allocation, and payroll integration for workforce time tracking.

## Overview

Documenting work hours or activities involves recording employee time entries, tracking project allocations, calculating overtime, managing time-off requests, approving timesheets, and integrating hours data with payroll and billing systems. This definition exposes actions for time entry and approval, events for overtime alerts and deadline monitoring, and searches for timesheet retrieval and labor analytics.

| calculateOvertime | Compute overtime hours based on work rules and regulatory thresholds |
| allocateToProject | Assign recorded hours to specific projects or cost centers |
| requestTimeOff | Submit a request for paid or unpaid leave |
| generateLaborReport | Produce a summary of hours, costs, and utilization by period |

## Events

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { documentWorkHoursActivities } from '@headlessly/document-work-hours-activities'

const timekeeping = documentWorkHoursActivities()

// Record daily time entries
await timekeeping.recordTimeEntry({
  employeeId: 'EMP-0482',
  date: '2026-02-05',
  entries: [
    { project: 'PRJ-2026-018', task: 'design-review', hours: 3.5 },
    { project: 'PRJ-2026-022', task: 'client-meeting', hours: 2.0 },
    { project: 'ADMIN', task: 'team-standup', hours: 0.5 },
    { project: 'PRJ-2026-018', task: 'documentation', hours: 2.0 }
  ]
})

// Submit weekly timesheet
await timekeeping.submitTimesheet({
  employeeId: 'EMP-0482',
  period: { start: '2026-02-02', end: '2026-02-06' },
  totalHours: 42.5,
  approver: 'MGR-0115'
})

// Generate labor cost report
await timekeeping.generateLaborReport({
  period: 'January 2026',
  groupBy: 'project',
  includeOvertime: true,
  departments: ['engineering', 'design']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on approaching overtime
timekeeping.overtimeThresholdApproaching(async ({ employeeId, hoursWorked, threshold }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'shift-manager',
    message: `Employee ${employeeId} at ${hoursWorked} hours (overtime threshold: ${threshold})`
  })
})

// Auto-route rejected timesheets
timekeeping.timesheetRejected(async ({ employeeId, period, reason }) => {
  await notify({
    to: employeeId,
    message: `Timesheet for ${period} returned: ${reason}. Please revise and resubmit.`
  })
})
```
