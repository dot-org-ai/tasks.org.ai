## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainClientInformationServiceRecords } from '@headlessly/maintain-client-information-service-records'

const clients = maintainClientInformationServiceRecords()

// Create a new client profile
const profile = await clients.createClientProfile({
  name: 'Greenfield Manufacturing',
  type: 'corporate',
  industry: 'manufacturing',
  contacts: [
    { name: 'Jane Torres', role: 'VP Operations', email: 'jtorres@greenfield.com' }
  ],
  source: 'trade-show-2026'
})

// Document a service delivery
await clients.documentService({
  clientId: profile.id,
  service: 'equipment-installation',
  date: '2026-02-05',
  description: 'Installed conveyor system in Plant B',
  outcome: 'completed',
  technician: 'field-team-alpha'
})

// Process a GDPR data access request
await clients.processPrivacyRequest({
  clientId: profile.id,
  type: 'data-access',
  regulation: 'GDPR',
  deadline: '2026-03-05'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on data quality issues
clients.dataQualityIssueDetected(async ({ clientId, issue, field }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'data-quality-team',
    message: `Data issue for client ${clientId}: ${issue} in field ${field}`
  })
})

// Track privacy request deadlines
clients.privacyRequestReceived(async ({ clientId, type, deadline }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'privacy-officer',
    message: `${type} request from client ${clientId} due by ${deadline}`
  })
})
```
