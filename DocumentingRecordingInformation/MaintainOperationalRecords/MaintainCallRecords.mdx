## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainCallRecords } from '@headlessly/maintain-call-records'

const calls = maintainCallRecords()

// Log a new inbound call
const record = await calls.logCall({
  direction: 'inbound',
  agentId: 'agent-042',
  customerId: 'cust-8891',
  startTime: '2026-02-05T09:15:00Z',
  duration: 342,
  disposition: 'resolved'
})

// Categorize the call
await calls.categorizeCall({
  callRecordId: record.id,
  category: 'billing-inquiry',
  subcategory: 'payment-dispute'
})

// Archive records older than 2 years
await calls.archiveRecords({
  olderThan: '2024-02-05',
  retentionPolicyId: 'policy-standard-2yr'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify compliance when records are purged
calls.expiredRecordsPurged(async ({ batchId, count, policy }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'compliance-team',
    message: `Purged ${count} call records under policy ${policy.name}`
  })
})

// Auto-archive when volume threshold is reached
calls.callLogged(async ({ callRecordId, createdAt }) => {
  const volume = await calls.getCallVolume({ period: 'current-month' })
  if (volume.total > 50000) {
    await calls.archiveRecords({
      olderThan: thirtyDaysAgo(),
      retentionPolicyId: 'policy-high-volume'
    })
  }
})
```
