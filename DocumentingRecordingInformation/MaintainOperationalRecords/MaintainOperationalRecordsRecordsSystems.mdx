## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainOperationalRecordsRecordsSystems } from '@headlessly/maintain-operational-records-records-systems'

const records = maintainOperationalRecordsRecordsSystems()

// Create and classify a new operational record
const record = await records.createRecord({
  title: 'Monthly Production Report - January 2026',
  department: 'manufacturing',
  type: 'operational-report',
  sourceSystem: 'erp-production'
})

await records.classifyRecord({
  recordId: record.id,
  recordClass: 'operational-reports',
  retentionPeriod: '7-years'
})

await records.storeRecord({
  recordId: record.id,
  location: 'document-management-system',
  accessLevel: 'department-restricted'
})

// Retrieve a record for audit
const retrieved = await records.retrieveRecord({
  recordId: record.id,
  requestedBy: 'auditor-external-01',
  purpose: 'annual-compliance-review'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-classify records based on source system
records.recordCreated(async ({ recordId, sourceSystem, type }) => {
  const classification = await determineClass(sourceSystem, type)
  await records.classifyRecord({
    recordId,
    recordClass: classification.recordClass,
    retentionPeriod: classification.retentionPeriod
  })
})

// Notify records manager when disposition batch is ready
records.retentionPolicyApplied(async ({ recordsExpired }) => {
  if (recordsExpired.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'records-manager',
      message: `${recordsExpired.length} records eligible for disposition review`
    })
  }
})
```
