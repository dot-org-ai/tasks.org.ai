## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainStudentRecords } from '@headlessly/maintain-student-records'

const students = maintainStudentRecords()

// Create a new student record upon admission
const record = await students.createStudentRecord({
  studentId: 'STU-2026-10482',
  name: 'Alex Rivera',
  program: 'BS Computer Science',
  admissionTerm: 'Fall 2026',
  advisor: 'Dr. Kim'
})

// Record course enrollment
await students.recordEnrollment({
  studentId: record.studentId,
  term: 'Fall 2026',
  courses: [
    { code: 'CS-201', title: 'Data Structures', credits: 3 },
    { code: 'MATH-301', title: 'Linear Algebra', credits: 3 },
    { code: 'CS-210', title: 'Computer Architecture', credits: 3 }
  ]
})

// Post final grades at end of term
await students.postGrades({
  studentId: record.studentId,
  term: 'Fall 2026',
  grades: [
    { course: 'CS-201', grade: 'A', credits: 3 },
    { course: 'MATH-301', grade: 'B+', credits: 3 },
    { course: 'CS-210', grade: 'A-', credits: 3 }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert advisor on academic standing changes
students.academicStandingChanged(async ({ studentId, newStanding, gpa }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'academic-advising',
    message: `Student ${studentId} standing changed to ${newStanding} (GPA: ${gpa})`
  })
})

// Auto-generate transcript on degree completion
students.degreeAuditUpdated(async ({ studentId, percentComplete, degreeRequirementsMet }) => {
  if (degreeRequirementsMet) {
    await students.generateTranscript({ studentId, type: 'official', reason: 'degree-completion' })
  }
})
```
