## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainRecordsDocumentsFiles } from '@headlessly/maintain-records-documents-files'

const records = maintainRecordsDocumentsFiles()

// Classify and file a new document
const doc = await records.classifyDocument({
  title: 'Q1 2026 Board Minutes',
  category: 'corporate-governance',
  department: 'executive-office',
  accessLevel: 'confidential',
  author: 'corporate-secretary'
})

await records.fileDocument({
  documentId: doc.id,
  repository: 'digital-vault',
  file: 'governance/board-minutes-q1-2026.pdf',
  tags: ['board', 'minutes', 'quarterly']
})

// Apply retention and manage lifecycle
await records.applyRetentionSchedule({
  category: 'corporate-governance',
  retentionYears: 10,
  disposalMethod: 'secure-shred'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on approaching retention expiration
records.retentionExpiring(async ({ category, documentCount, expirationDate }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'records-manager',
    message: `${documentCount} documents in ${category} expire on ${expirationDate}`
  })
})

// Notify legal on new hold placement
records.holdPlaced(async ({ holdId, reason, documentCount }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'legal-counsel',
    message: `Litigation hold ${holdId} placed on ${documentCount} records: ${reason}`
  })
})
```
