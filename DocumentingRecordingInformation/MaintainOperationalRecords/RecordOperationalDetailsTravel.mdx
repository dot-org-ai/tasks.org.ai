## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { recordOperationalDetailsTravel } from '@headlessly/record-operational-details-travel'

const travel = recordOperationalDetailsTravel()

// Log a completed trip
const trip = await travel.logTrip({
  vehicleId: 'TRK-4410',
  driverId: 'DRV-0087',
  route: { origin: 'Chicago, IL', destination: 'Indianapolis, IN' },
  departure: '2026-02-04T06:00:00Z',
  arrival: '2026-02-04T09:45:00Z',
  mileage: 184
})

// Record fuel consumption for the trip
await travel.recordFuelConsumption({
  tripId: trip.id,
  gallons: 28.5,
  cost: 98.32,
  station: 'Interstate Fuel Stop #412'
})

// Log driver hours of service
await travel.logDriverHours({
  driverId: 'DRV-0087',
  date: '2026-02-04',
  driving: 3.75,
  onDuty: 5.0,
  offDuty: 10.0,
  sleeper: 8.0
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert dispatcher when driver approaches hours limit
travel.hoursLimitApproaching(async ({ driverId, remainingHours }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'dispatch-team',
    message: `Driver ${driverId} has ${remainingHours}h remaining before hours-of-service limit`
  })
})

// Auto-generate weekly travel summaries
travel.tripLogged(async ({ vehicleId, date }) => {
  if (isEndOfWeek(date)) {
    await travel.generateTravelSummary({
      vehicleId,
      period: 'weekly'
    })
  }
})
```
