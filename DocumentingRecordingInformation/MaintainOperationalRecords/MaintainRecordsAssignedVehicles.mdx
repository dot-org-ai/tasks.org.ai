# Maintain Records of Assigned Vehicles

> Business-as-Code definition for assigned vehicle record maintenance. Models the lifecycle from vehicle acquisition through driver assignment, mileage tracking, fuel logging, maintenance scheduling, inspection documentation, and fleet disposition.

## Overview

Maintaining records of assigned vehicles involves documenting vehicle acquisitions, tracking driver assignments and authorizations, logging mileage and fuel consumption, recording maintenance and repair histories, documenting regulatory inspections, managing registration and insurance documentation, and producing fleet utilization reports. This definition exposes actions for vehicle documentation and fleet tracking, events for inspection deadlines and maintenance alerts, and searches for fleet performance and compliance status.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainRecordsAssignedVehicles } from '@headlessly/maintain-records-assigned-vehicles'

const fleet = maintainRecordsAssignedVehicles()

// Register a new fleet vehicle
const vehicle = await fleet.registerVehicle({
  vin: '1FTFW1E53MFA12345',
  make: 'Ford',
  model: 'F-150',
  year: 2026,
  type: 'pickup-truck',
  acquisitionDate: '2026-01-15',
  acquisitionCost: 48500,
  odometerAtAcquisition: 12,
  assignedDepot: 'north-operations'
})

// Assign a driver
await fleet.assignDriver({
  vehicleId: vehicle.id,
  driverId: 'DRV-0224',
  driverName: 'Tom Reeves',
  licenseNumber: 'D4412887',
  licenseClass: 'C',
  effectiveDate: '2026-02-01'
})

// Log daily mileage and fuel
await fleet.logMileage({
  vehicleId: vehicle.id,
  date: '2026-02-05',
  startOdometer: 1247,
  endOdometer: 1312,
  route: 'north-service-loop'
})

await fleet.logFuel({
  vehicleId: vehicle.id,
  date: '2026-02-05',
  gallons: 14.8,
  cost: 52.34,
  station: 'Fleet Fuels - Station 7',
  odometer: 1312
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on upcoming service intervals
fleet.serviceDue(async ({ vehicleId, vehicleName, serviceType, dueOdometer }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'fleet-mechanic',
    message: `${serviceType} due for ${vehicleName} (${vehicleId}) at ${dueOdometer} miles`
  })
})

// Notify compliance on expired inspections
fleet.inspectionRecorded(async ({ vehicleId, nextInspectionDue }) => {
  const daysUntilDue = daysBetween(new Date(), new Date(nextInspectionDue))
  if (daysUntilDue <= 30) {
    await notify({
      to: 'compliance-coordinator',
      message: `Vehicle ${vehicleId} inspection due in ${daysUntilDue} days - schedule renewal`
    })
  }
})
```
