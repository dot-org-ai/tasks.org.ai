## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { presentResearchResultsOthers } from '@headlessly/present-research-results-others'

const presentations = presentResearchResultsOthers()

// Create a new presentation
const pres = await presentations.createPresentation({
  title: 'Novel Findings in Urban Air Quality Monitoring',
  abstract: 'Presents sensor network data from 12 metropolitan areas',
  format: 'conference-talk',
  researchReportId: 'report-air-quality-2026'
})

// Build slides and schedule
await presentations.buildSlideDeck({
  presentationId: pres.id,
  template: 'academic-standard',
  sections: ['introduction', 'methodology', 'results', 'conclusions']
})

await presentations.scheduleSession({
  presentationId: pres.id,
  venue: 'Environmental Science Conference 2026',
  date: '2026-06-15T14:00:00Z',
  duration: 30,
  format: 'in-person'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-distribute handouts after presentation delivery
presentations.presentationDelivered(async ({ presentationId }) => {
  await presentations.distributeHandouts({
    presentationId,
    channels: ['email', 'conference-portal']
  })
})

// Notify sponsor of successful dissemination
presentations.feedbackCollected(async ({ presentationId, responseCount }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'research-sponsor',
    message: `Presentation ${presentationId} delivered with ${responseCount} audience responses`
  })
})
```
