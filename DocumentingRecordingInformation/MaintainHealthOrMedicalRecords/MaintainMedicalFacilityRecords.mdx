# Maintain Medical Facility Records

> Business-as-Code definition for medical facility record maintenance. Models the lifecycle from facility licensing through accreditation documentation, equipment logs, incident reporting, staffing records, and regulatory compliance tracking.

## Overview

Maintaining medical facility records involves managing documentation for licensing and accreditation, tracking equipment maintenance and calibration logs, recording facility inspections, documenting staffing credentials and certifications, maintaining incident and safety reports, and ensuring compliance with healthcare regulations. This definition exposes actions for facility documentation management, events for compliance deadline monitoring, and searches for audit readiness and facility performance tracking.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainMedicalFacilityRecords } from '@headlessly/maintain-medical-facility-records'

const facility = maintainMedicalFacilityRecords()

// Log equipment preventive maintenance
await facility.logEquipmentMaintenance({
  deviceId: 'MRI-SCANNER-001',
  deviceName: 'Siemens Magnetom Aera 1.5T',
  maintenanceType: 'preventive',
  serviceDate: '2026-02-05',
  technician: 'biomed-eng-rkapoor',
  findings: 'Coils within specification. Helium level at 68%. Gradient performance nominal.',
  nextServiceDue: '2026-05-05'
})

// File a regulatory inspection report
await facility.fileInspectionReport({
  inspector: 'state-health-dept',
  inspectionDate: '2026-01-28',
  areas: ['emergency-department', 'pharmacy', 'infection-control'],
  findings: [
    { area: 'pharmacy', severity: 'minor', description: 'Temperature log missing 2 entries' }
  ],
  correctiveActionDue: '2026-02-28'
})

// Track an expiring staff credential
await facility.trackCredential({
  staffId: 'RN-0412',
  credentialType: 'registered-nurse-license',
  state: 'CA',
  licenseNumber: 'RN-887412',
  expirationDate: '2026-04-30',
  status: 'active'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on expiring staff credentials
facility.credentialExpiring(async ({ staffId, credentialType, expirationDate }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'credentialing-coordinator',
    message: `${credentialType} for staff ${staffId} expires ${expirationDate} - initiate renewal`
  })
})

// Escalate unresolved incidents
facility.incidentReported(async ({ incidentId, severity, department }) => {
  if (severity === 'critical') {
    await notify({
      to: 'facility-administrator',
      message: `Critical incident ${incidentId} reported in ${department} - immediate review required`
    })
  }
})
```
