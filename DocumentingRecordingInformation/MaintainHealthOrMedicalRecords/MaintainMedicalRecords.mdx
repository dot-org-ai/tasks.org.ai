| RegulatoryBody | Establishes record retention and privacy requirements |
| Laboratory | Submits test results and diagnostic reports |
| ReferringFacility | Sends or receives records during patient transfers |

|------|-------------|
| MedicalRecordsClerk | Manages day-to-day record creation, filing, and retrieval |
| HealthInformationManager | Oversees record policies, compliance, and quality |
| ClinicalDocumentationSpecialist | Ensures accuracy and completeness of clinical entries |
| PrivacyOfficer | Monitors access controls and regulatory compliance |

## Entities

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| PatientRecord | The comprehensive medical file for an individual patient |
| ClinicalEncounter | A documented interaction between patient and provider |
| DiagnosisEntry | A coded diagnosis associated with a patient visit |
| MedicationLog | Record of prescribed and administered medications |
| ConsentForm | Patient authorization for treatment or information release |
| AuditTrail | Log of all access and modifications to a patient record |

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| createRecord | Initialize a new patient medical record |
| updateEncounter | Add or modify clinical encounter documentation |
| recordDiagnosis | Enter a coded diagnosis into the patient record |
| attachDocument | Associate lab results, imaging, or external documents |
| releaseRecord | Authorize and transmit records to a requesting party |
| archiveRecord | Move inactive records to long-term compliant storage |
| auditAccess | Review who has accessed or modified a record |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| recordCreated | A new patient medical record has been initialized |
| encounterUpdated | Clinical encounter documentation has been modified |
| diagnosisRecorded | A diagnosis entry has been added to the record |
| documentAttached | An external document has been linked to the record |
| recordReleased | A patient record has been transmitted to a requesting party |
| recordArchived | An inactive record has been moved to archival storage |
| unauthorizedAccessDetected | An access attempt has violated privacy controls |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| findPatientRecords | Locate records by patient name, identifier, or date of birth |
| getEncounterHistory | Retrieve all clinical encounters for a patient within a date range |
| getAuditLog | List all access and modification events for a specific record |
| findRecordsByDiagnosis | Search records by diagnosis code or condition |
| getPendingReleases | Retrieve record release requests awaiting authorization |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainMedicalRecords } from '@headlessly/maintain-medical-records'

const records = maintainMedicalRecords()

// Create a new patient record
const record = await records.createRecord({
  patientId: 'PAT-2026-00451',
  fullName: 'Jane Doe',
  dateOfBirth: '1985-03-14',
  insuranceId: 'INS-882341'
})

// Update a clinical encounter
await records.updateEncounter({
  recordId: record.id,
  encounterId: 'ENC-20260205',
  notes: 'Patient presents with acute bronchitis. Prescribed amoxicillin.',
  providerId: 'DR-1122'
})

// Attach lab results
await records.attachDocument({
  recordId: record.id,
  documentType: 'LabResult',
  source: 'CityLab',
  fileRef: 'lab-results/CBC-20260205.pdf'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Flag unauthorized access attempts
records.unauthorizedAccessDetected(async ({ recordId, userId, timestamp }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'privacy-officer',
    message: `Unauthorized access to record ${recordId} by ${userId} at ${timestamp}`
  })
})

// Auto-archive inactive records after retention period
records.encounterUpdated(async ({ recordId, lastEncounterDate }) => {
  const inactiveYears = yearsSince(lastEncounterDate)
  if (inactiveYears >= 7) {
    await records.archiveRecord({ recordId, reason: 'Retention period exceeded' })
  }
})
```
