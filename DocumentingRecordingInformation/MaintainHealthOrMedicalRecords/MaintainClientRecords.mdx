# Maintain Client Records

> Business-as-Code definition for client record maintenance in health and human services settings. Models the lifecycle from intake documentation through ongoing updates, consent management, progress tracking, and secure archival of client case files.

## Overview

Maintaining client records involves creating and updating intake documents, tracking service history, recording progress notes and assessment outcomes, managing consent and authorization forms, and ensuring compliance with confidentiality regulations such as HIPAA and state privacy laws. This definition exposes actions for record creation and updates, events for compliance monitoring and case milestones, and searches for client history and caseload management.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainClientRecords } from '@headlessly/maintain-client-records'

const records = maintainClientRecords()

// Create a new client record at intake
const client = await records.createClientRecord({
  firstName: 'Maria',
  lastName: 'Gonzalez',
  dateOfBirth: '1988-04-12',
  referralSource: 'county-behavioral-health',
  primaryNeed: 'substance-use-treatment',
  assignedTo: 'case-manager-tsmith',
  intakeDate: '2026-02-05'
})

// Record a progress note after a session
await records.recordProgressNote({
  clientId: client.id,
  date: '2026-02-05',
  type: 'individual-session',
  duration: 50,
  content: 'Client reported reduced cravings. Reviewed relapse prevention strategies.',
  goals: ['goal-sobriety-90-day'],
  author: 'counselor-jpatel'
})

// Manage consent renewal
await records.manageConsent({
  clientId: client.id,
  consentType: 'treatment-authorization',
  status: 'renewed',
  effectiveDate: '2026-02-05',
  expirationDate: '2027-02-05'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert case managers about expiring consents
records.consentExpiring(async ({ clientId, clientName, consentType, expirationDate }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'case-manager',
    message: `Consent for ${clientName} (${consentType}) expires ${expirationDate} - renewal required`
  })
})

// Trigger archival workflow on discharge
records.clientDischarged(async ({ clientId, dischargeDate }) => {
  await records.archiveRecord({
    clientId,
    retentionPeriod: '7-years',
    archiveDate: dischargeDate
  })
})
```
