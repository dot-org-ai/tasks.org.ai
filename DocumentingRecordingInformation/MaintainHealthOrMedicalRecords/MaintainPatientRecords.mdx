# Maintain Patient Records

> Business-as-Code definition for patient record maintenance. Models the complete lifecycle from registration through clinical documentation, order tracking, diagnosis coding, discharge planning, and long-term record retention within electronic health record systems.

## Overview

Maintaining patient records involves creating and updating demographic information, documenting clinical encounters and physician orders, recording diagnoses and procedure codes, tracking referrals and follow-up care, managing record amendments, and ensuring HIPAA-compliant storage and access controls. This definition exposes actions for clinical documentation and record management, events for care coordination triggers and compliance alerts, and searches for patient history retrieval and population health analytics.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainPatientRecords } from '@headlessly/maintain-patient-records'

const records = maintainPatientRecords()

// Register a new patient
const patient = await records.registerPatient({
  firstName: 'James',
  lastName: 'Mitchell',
  dateOfBirth: '1972-09-14',
  mrn: 'MRN-0088214',
  insurance: {
    payer: 'Blue Cross',
    memberId: 'BC-7741228',
    groupNumber: 'GRP-5501'
  },
  registeredBy: 'registration-clerk-alee'
})

// Document a clinical encounter
await records.documentEncounter({
  patientId: patient.id,
  date: '2026-02-05',
  provider: 'dr-kwilson',
  type: 'office-visit',
  chiefComplaint: 'Persistent lower back pain for 3 weeks',
  findings: 'Tenderness at L4-L5. Limited range of motion. Straight leg raise negative.',
  plan: 'MRI lumbar spine, physical therapy referral, NSAIDs as needed'
})

// Assign diagnosis and procedure codes
await records.assignCodes({
  encounterId: 'ENC-2026-04421',
  diagnoses: [{ code: 'M54.5', description: 'Low back pain' }],
  procedures: [{ code: '99214', description: 'Office visit, moderate complexity' }],
  codedBy: 'coder-dpatel'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Route new orders for processing
records.orderEntered(async ({ patientId, orderType, provider }) => {
  await notify({
    to: `${orderType}-department`,
    message: `New ${orderType} order for patient ${patientId} from ${provider}`
  })
})

// Alert on pending record amendments
records.recordAmended(async ({ patientId, amendmentType, requestedBy }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'medical-records-supervisor',
    message: `Amendment (${amendmentType}) requested by ${requestedBy} for patient ${patientId}`
  })
})
```
