### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { performMarketingActivities } from '@headlessly/perform-marketing-activities'

const marketing = performMarketingActivities()

// Plan a product launch campaign
const campaign = await marketing.planCampaign({
  name: 'Spring Product Launch 2026',
  objective: 'lead-generation',
  audience: 'smb-technology-buyers',
  channels: ['email', 'linkedin', 'search'],
  budget: 25000,

})

// Create and launch content
await marketing.createContent({
  campaignId: campaign.id,
  assets: ['landing-page', 'email-sequence', 'social-posts']
})

await marketing.launchCampaign({ campaignId: campaign.id })

  metrics: ['impressions', 'clicks', 'conversions', 'cost-per-lead']
})
```

// Auto-route new leads to sales
marketing.leadCaptured(async ({ leadId, campaign, score }) => {
  if (score > 70) {
    await routeToSales({ leadId, priority: 'high' })
  }
})

// Alert team when budget is 80% spent
marketing.performanceTracked(async ({ campaignId, budgetSpent, budgetTotal }) => {
  if (budgetSpent / budgetTotal > 0.8) {
    await notify({
      to: 'marketing-team',
      message: `Campaign ${campaignId} has used 80% of budget`
    })
  }
})
```
