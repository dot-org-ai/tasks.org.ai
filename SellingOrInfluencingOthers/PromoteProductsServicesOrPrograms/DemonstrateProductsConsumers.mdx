## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { demonstrateProductsConsumers } from '@headlessly/demonstrate-products-consumers'

const demos = demonstrateProductsConsumers()

// Schedule a product demonstration
const event = await demos.scheduleDemonstration({
  product: 'smart-home-hub-v3',
  venue: 'bestbuy-store-1205',
  date: '2026-03-15',
  timeSlot: '14:00-17:00',
  format: 'in-store-interactive'
})

// Conduct the demonstration
await demos.conductDemonstration({
  eventId: event.id,
  script: 'smart-home-setup-demo',
  samplesUsed: 5,
  attendees: 42
})

// Track resulting conversions
await demos.trackConversion({
  eventId: event.id,
  salesCount: 8,
  leadsGenerated: 15,
  totalRevenue: 3192
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-prepare demo kit when demonstration is scheduled
demos.demonstrationScheduled(async ({ eventId, product, venue }) => {
  await demos.prepareDemoKit({
    eventId,
    product,
    shipTo: venue,
    items: ['product-samples', 'display-stand', 'brochures']
  })
})

// Alert sales team on high-conversion demonstrations
demos.resultsReported(async ({ eventId, conversionRate, product }) => {
  if (conversionRate > 0.2) {
    await notify({
      to: 'sales-leadership',
      message: `High-performing demo for ${product}: ${Math.round(conversionRate * 100)}% conversion`
    })
  }
})
```
