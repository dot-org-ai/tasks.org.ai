### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { marketProductsServicesEvents } from '@headlessly/market-products-services-events'

const market = marketProductsServicesEvents()

// Define positioning for a new product
await market.definePositioning({
  product: 'CloudSync Pro',
  valueProposition: 'Real-time data synchronization for distributed teams',
  competitors: ['SyncBase', 'DataBridge'],
  differentiators: ['sub-second latency', 'zero-config setup']
})

  product: 'CloudSync Pro',
  channel: 'linkedin',

  targetSegment: 'enterprise-it-directors'
})

await market.placeMedia({
  advertisementId: ad.id,

})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Track ROI when conversions are measured
market.conversionMeasured(async ({ channel, conversions, spend }) => {
  const roi = (conversions * averageDealValue - spend) / spend
  await logMetric({ event: 'channel-roi', channel, roi })
})

// Pause underperforming ads
market.conversionMeasured(async ({ advertisementId, conversionRate }) => {
  if (conversionRate < 0.01) {
    await market.adjustStrategy({
      advertisementId,
      action: 'pause',
      reason: 'below-threshold-conversion-rate'
    })
  }
})
