## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { distributePromotionalLiteratureSamplesCustomers } from '@headlessly/distribute-promotional-literature-samples-customers'

const distribution = distributePromotionalLiteratureSamplesCustomers()

// Plan a distribution campaign
const campaign = await distribution.planDistribution({
  product: 'organic-skincare-line',
  materials: ['product-catalog', 'sample-sachets', 'discount-coupon'],
  channels: ['direct-mail', 'in-store-display'],
  targetRegion: 'pacific-northwest',
  targetVolume: 10000
})

// Order materials and stock locations
await distribution.orderMaterials({
  campaignId: campaign.id,
  items: [
    { type: 'catalog', quantity: 10000 },
    { type: 'sample-sachet', quantity: 10000 },
    { type: 'coupon-card', quantity: 10000 }
  ]
})

// Execute delivery
await distribution.executeDelivery({
  campaignId: campaign.id,
  channel: 'direct-mail',
  addresses: 8000,
  dropDate: '2026-03-01'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-restock when inventory runs low
distribution.pickupsTracked(async ({ locationId, remaining, threshold }) => {
  if (remaining < threshold) {
    await distribution.stockLocations({
      locationId,
      replenishQuantity: threshold * 2
    })
  }
})

// Alert marketing on high redemption campaigns
distribution.redemptionMeasured(async ({ campaignId, redemptionRate }) => {
  if (redemptionRate > 0.15) {
    await notify({
      to: 'marketing-team',
      message: `Campaign ${campaignId} achieving ${Math.round(redemptionRate * 100)}% redemption rate`
    })
  }
})
```
