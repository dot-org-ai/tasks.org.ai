## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { promoteProductsServicesPrograms } from '@headlessly/promote-products-services-programs'

const promo = promoteProductsServicesPrograms()

// Define a promotional strategy
const strategy = await promo.defineStrategy({
  offering: 'professional-certification-program',
  objectives: ['increase-enrollment-30-percent', 'build-brand-awareness'],
  audience: 'mid-career-professionals',
  channels: ['linkedin', 'email', 'webinar'],
  budget: 25000
})

// Create and launch promotional assets
const assets = await promo.createAssets({
  strategyId: strategy.id,
  formats: [
    { type: 'linkedin-sponsored-post', count: 5 },
    { type: 'email-sequence', count: 4 },
    { type: 'webinar-landing-page', count: 1 }
  ]
})

await promo.launchCampaign({
  strategyId: strategy.id,
  startDate: '2026-03-01',
  endDate: '2026-04-30'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-optimize when performance data is available
promo.resultsReported(async ({ campaignId, channels }) => {
  const underperforming = channels.filter(c => c.cpa > c.targetCPA)
  if (underperforming.length > 0) {
    await promo.optimizeSpend({
      campaignId,
      reduce: underperforming.map(c => c.name),
      increase: channels.filter(c => c.cpa <= c.targetCPA * 0.8).map(c => c.name)
    })
  }
})

// Notify team when campaign launches
promo.campaignLaunched(async ({ campaignId, offering, channels }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'marketing-team',
    message: `Campaign for ${offering} is live on ${channels.join(', ')}`
  })
})
```
