const sustainability = promoteEnvironmentalSustainabilityConservationInit()

// Develop a conservation campaign
const campaign = await sustainability.developCampaign({
  name: 'Green Commute Challenge',
  goal: 'reduce-commuter-emissions-20-percent',

  if (goalProgress >= 100) {
    await notify({
      to: 'executive-team',
      message: `Campaign ${campaignId} has achieved its sustainability target`
