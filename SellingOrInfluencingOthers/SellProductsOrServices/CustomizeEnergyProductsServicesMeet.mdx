# Customize Energy Products or Services to Meet Customer Needs

> Business-as-Code definition for energy product and service customization. Models the process of assessing customer energy requirements, designing tailored energy solutions, and delivering customized utility, renewable, or efficiency products.

## Overview

Customizing energy products involves evaluating customer consumption patterns, infrastructure, and sustainability goals to configure tailored energy supply contracts, renewable installations, or efficiency programs. This definition exposes actions for energy solution design and delivery, event triggers for project milestones, and searches for consumption analytics and proposal records.

| solutionDesigned | A tailored energy configuration has been created |
| pricingDeveloped | A custom rate structure or financing plan has been built |
| proposalPresented | The energy solution has been recommended to the customer |
| designApproved | Technical and regulatory approvals have been obtained |
| installationScheduled | Equipment deployment timeline has been planned |
| systemCommissioned | The energy solution has been activated and verified |
| performanceMeasured | Energy output or savings have been tracked against targets |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| findAssessments | List energy assessments by customer, type, or date |
| getDesigns | Retrieve solution configurations by technology, capacity, or customer |
| getProposals | Search proposals by customer, status, or solution type |
| getPerformance | Query energy savings or output data by system, period, or target |
| getContracts | Find service contracts by customer, term, or pricing structure |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { customizeEnergyProductsServicesMeet } from '@headlessly/customize-energy-products-services-meet'

const energy = customizeEnergyProductsServicesMeet()

// Assess customer energy consumption
const assessment = await energy.assessConsumption({
  customerId: 'cust-industrial-4420',
  facilityType: 'manufacturing-plant',
  annualConsumption: { amount: 850000, unit: 'kWh' },
  peakDemand: { amount: 350, unit: 'kW' },
  sustainabilityGoals: ['carbon-neutral-2030', 'reduce-peak-demand']
})

// Design a tailored solar and battery solution
const design = await energy.designSolution({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  components: [
    { type: 'solar-array', capacity: '200kW' },
    { type: 'battery-storage', capacity: '500kWh' },
    { type: 'demand-response', program: 'peak-shaving' }
  ]
})

// Present the proposal
await energy.presentProposal({
  designId: design.id,
  projectedSavings: 120000,
  paybackPeriod: 4.5,
  financingOption: 'power-purchase-agreement'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-schedule installation when design is approved
energy.designApproved(async ({ designId, customerId }) => {
  await energy.scheduleInstallation({
    designId,
    customerId,
    preferredWindow: 'next-available'
  })
})

// Alert on underperformance against guarantees
energy.performanceMeasured(async ({ systemId, actual, guaranteed }) => {
  if (actual < guaranteed * 0.9) {
    await notify({
      to: 'operations-team',
      message: `System ${systemId} performing at ${Math.round(actual / guaranteed * 100)}% of guarantee`
    })
  }
})
```
