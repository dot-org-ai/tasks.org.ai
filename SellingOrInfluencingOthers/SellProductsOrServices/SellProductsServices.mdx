### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { sellProductsServices } from '@headlessly/sell-products-services'

const sales = sellProductsServices()

// Qualify a new lead
const lead = await sales.qualifyLead({
  contactName: 'Sarah Chen',
  company: 'TechStart Inc',
  budget: 50000,
  timeline: 'Q2-2026',
  need: 'enterprise-crm'
})

// Create an opportunity and present a proposal
const opportunity = await sales.createOpportunity({
  leadId: lead.id,
  estimatedValue: 48000,
  products: ['crm-platform', 'onboarding-services']
})

await sales.presentProposal({
  opportunityId: opportunity.id,
  pricing: { platform: 36000, services: 12000 },
  terms: { paymentSchedule: 'net-30', contractLength: 12 }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify sales manager on high-value deal closure
sales.dealClosed(async ({ opportunityId, value, representative }) => {
  if (value > 100000) {
    await notify({
      to: 'sales-manager',
      message: `${representative} closed a $${value} deal`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-generate invoice after order processing
sales.orderProcessed(async ({ orderId, customerId, total }) => {
  await sales.issueInvoice({
    orderId,
    customerId,
    amount: total,
    dueDate: addDays(new Date(), 30)
  })
})
```
