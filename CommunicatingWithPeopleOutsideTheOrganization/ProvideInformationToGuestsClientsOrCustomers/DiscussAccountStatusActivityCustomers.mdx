### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { discussAccountStatusActivityCustomers } from '@headlessly/discuss-account-status-activity-customers'

const accountService = discussAccountStatusActivityCustomers()

// Review recent account activity with customer
const activity = await accountService.reviewActivity({
  accountId: 'account-456',
  period: 'last-30-days',
  includeTransactions: true,
  includeBilling: true
})

// Explain specific charges
await accountService.explainCharges({
  accountId: 'account-456',
  transactionIds: ['txn-123', 'txn-124'],
  explanationDetails: [
    'Monthly service fee per plan terms',
    'Overage charges for exceeding data limit'
  ]
})

// Identify opportunity for plan upgrade
const opportunity = await accountService.identifyOpportunity({
  accountId: 'account-456',
  opportunityType: 'plan-upgrade',
  reasoning: 'Customer consistently exceeding current plan limits',
  estimatedBenefit: { costSavings: 25, improvedService: true }
})

// Document the discussion
await accountService.documentDiscussion({
  accountId: 'account-456',

  topics: ['billing-inquiry', 'service-optimization'],
  outcome: 'customer-satisfied',
  nextSteps: ['schedule-follow-up-next-month']

accountService.discussionDocumented(async ({ accountId, topics }) => {
  const account = await accountService.findAccounts({ id: accountId })
  if (account.tier === 'premium') {
    await accountService.scheduleFollowup({
      accountId,
      followupDate: addDays(new Date(), 30),
      purpose: 'regular-account-review'
    })
  }
})

// Alert retention team when issues are unresolved
accountService.issueResolved(async ({ accountId, resolved }) => {
  if (!resolved) {
    const issues = await accountService.getIssues({ accountId, status: 'open' })
    if (issues.length > 2) {
      await notify({
