## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { informIndividualsOrganizationsStatusFindings } from '@headlessly/inform-individuals-organizations-status-findings'

const notifications = informIndividualsOrganizationsStatusFindings()

// Prepare a project status update
const notification = await notifications.prepareNotification({
  type: 'status_update',
  recipient: { type: 'Client', id: 'client-789' },
  subject: 'Q1 Implementation Status',
  content: {
    status: 'On Track',
    milestones: [
      { name: 'Phase 1', completed: true },
      { name: 'Phase 2', progress: 75 }
    ]
  }
})

// Send the notification
await notifications.sendNotification({
  notificationId: notification.id,
  deliveryMethods: ['email', 'portal'],
  requireAcknowledgment: true
})

// Track delivery status
const status = await notifications.trackDelivery({
  notificationId: notification.id
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Retry failed deliveries
notifications.deliveryFailed(async ({ notificationId, reason }) => {
  await wait({ minutes: 30 })
  await notifications.resendNotification({ notificationId })
})

// Alert on missing acknowledgments
notifications.notificationSent(async ({ notificationId, requireAcknowledgment }) => {
  if (requireAcknowledgment) {
    await wait({ days: 3 })
    const status = await notifications.getDeliveryStatus({ notificationId })
    if (!status.acknowledged) {
      await alert({
        to: 'account-manager',
        message: `No acknowledgment received for ${notificationId}`
      })
    }
  }
})
```
