### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { provideCustomerServiceClientsUsers } from '@headlessly/provide-customer-service-clients-users'

const customerService = provideCustomerServiceClientsUsers()

// Create a support ticket
const ticket = await customerService.createTicket({
  customerId: 'cust_123',
  channel: 'phone',
  category: 'billing_inquiry',
  priority: 'medium',
  description: 'Question about recent invoice charge'
})

// Respond to the inquiry
await customerService.respondToInquiry({
  ticketId: ticket.id,
  response: 'The charge is for annual subscription renewal',
  channel: 'email',
  attachments: ['invoice_breakdown.pdf']
})

// Resolve the issue
await customerService.resolveIssue({
  ticketId: ticket.id,
  resolution: 'Explanation provided, customer satisfied',

```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-escalate high-priority unresolved tickets
customerService.ticketCreated(async ({ ticketId, priority, category }) => {
  if (priority === 'critical' && category === 'service_outage') {
    await customerService.escalateTicket({
      ticketId,
      escalateTo: 'technical_support',
      reason: 'critical_service_issue'
    })
  }
})

// Auto-follow-up on low satisfaction ratings
customerService.feedbackCollected(async ({ ticketId, customerId, rating }) => {
  if (rating <= 2) {
    await customerService.followUpCustomer({
      customerId,
      ticketId,
      message: 'We apologize for your experience. How can we improve?'
    })
  }
