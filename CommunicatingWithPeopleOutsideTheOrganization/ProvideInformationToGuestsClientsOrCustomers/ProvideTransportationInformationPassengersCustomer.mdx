## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { provideTransportationInformationPassengersCustomer } from '@headlessly/provide-transportation-information-passengers-customer'

const transportation = provideTransportationInformationPassengersCustomer()

// Provide schedule information
const schedule = await transportation.provideSchedule({
  passengerId: 'passenger-789',
  from: 'Downtown Station',
  to: 'Airport Terminal',
  date: '2026-02-20',
  time: '14:00'
})

// Describe route with transfers
await transportation.describeRoute({
  routeId: schedule.routeId,
  details: {
    segments: [
      { mode: 'subway', line: 'Red Line', stops: 8, duration: 25 },
      { mode: 'transfer', location: 'Central Hub', duration: 5 },
      { mode: 'rail', line: 'Airport Express', stops: 2, duration: 15 }

// Auto-notify on service disruptions
transportation.serviceStatusUpdated(async ({ routeId, status }) => {
  if (status.delay > 15 || status.cancelled) {
    const passengers = await getAffectedPassengers({ routeId })
    await transportation.issueAlert({
      passengers,
      message: `Service disruption on ${routeId}: ${status.reason}`,
      alternatives: status.alternativeRoutes
    })
  }
})

// Arrange accommodations proactively
transportation.scheduleProvided(async ({ passengerId, routeId }) => {
  const profile = await getPassengerProfile({ passengerId })
  if (profile.mobilityAssistance) {
    await transportation.arrangeAccommodation({
      passengerId,
      routeId,
