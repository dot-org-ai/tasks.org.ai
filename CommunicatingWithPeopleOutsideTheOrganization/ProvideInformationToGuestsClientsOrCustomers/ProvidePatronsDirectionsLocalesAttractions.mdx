import { providePatronsDirectionsLocalesAttractions } from '@headlessly/provide-patrons-directions-locales-attractions'

const wayfinding = providePatronsDirectionsLocalesAttractions()

// Provide directions to an attraction
const directions = await wayfinding.provideDirections({
  patronId: 'guest-456',
  from: 'hotel-lobby',
  to: { name: 'City Museum', address: '123 Main St' },
  preferences: { mode: 'walking', avoidStairs: true }
})

// Create a custom accessible route

  patronId: 'guest-456',
  destinations: ['restaurant-789', 'theater-101', 'parking-garage'],
  requirements: ['wheelchair-accessible', 'covered-walkways']
})

  if (profile.mobilityAssistance) {
    await wayfinding.highlightAccessibility({
      routeId,
      features: ['elevator locations', 'ramp access', 'rest areas']
    })
  }
})

// Alert on route disruptions
wayfinding.customRouteCreated(async ({ routeId }) => {
  const status = await checkRouteStatus({ routeId })
  if (status.closures.length > 0) {
    await wayfinding.updateRouteStatus({
      routeId,
      closures: status.closures,
      alternatives: status.alternatives
    })
