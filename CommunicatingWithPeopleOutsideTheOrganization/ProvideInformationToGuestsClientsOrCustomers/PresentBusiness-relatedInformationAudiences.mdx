## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { presentBusinessRelatedInformationAudiences } from '@headlessly/present-business-related-information-audiences'

const presentations = presentBusinessRelatedInformationAudiences()

// Create a quarterly business review presentation
const presentation = await presentations.createPresentation({
  title: 'Q4 2025 Business Review',
  type: 'client_review',
  content: {
    slides: [
      { title: 'Executive Summary', content: '...' },
      { title: 'Performance Metrics', content: '...' },
      { title: 'Strategic Initiatives', content: '...' }
    ]
  }
})

// Schedule and invite audience
const session = await presentations.scheduleSession({
  presentationId: presentation.id,
  date: '2026-01-15',
  time: '14:00',
  venue: { type: 'virtual', platform: 'Zoom' }
})

await presentations.inviteAudience({
  sessionId: session.id,
  attendees: [
    { email: 'cfo@client.com', role: 'Executive' },
    { email: 'director@client.com', role: 'Decision Maker' }
  ]
})

// Deliver and record
await presentations.deliverPresentation({
  sessionId: session.id,
  record: true
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Share recording after positive feedback
presentations.feedbackCollected(async ({ sessionId, feedback }) => {
  const avgScore = feedback.reduce((acc, f) => acc + f.score, 0) / feedback.length
  if (avgScore >= 4.0) {
    await presentations.shareRecording({
      sessionId,
      recipients: ['marketing-team', 'sales-team']
    })
  }
})

// Follow up on low attendance
presentations.presentationDelivered(async ({ sessionId }) => {
  const attendees = await presentations.getAttendees({ sessionId })
  if (attendees.attendanceRate < 0.5) {
    await notify({
      to: 'audience-manager',
      message: `Low attendance (${attendees.attendanceRate * 100}%) for session ${sessionId}`
    })
  }
})
```
