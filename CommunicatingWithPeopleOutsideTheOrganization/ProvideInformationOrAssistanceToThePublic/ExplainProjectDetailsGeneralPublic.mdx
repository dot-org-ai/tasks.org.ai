  projectId: 'bridge-renovation-2026',
  topics: ['timeline', 'traffic-impacts', 'safety-improvements', 'budget'],
  audience: 'general-public',

    category: question.topic
  })
})

// Alert project team when negative feedback threshold is reached
publicEngagement.feedbackCollected(async ({ projectId, feedback }) => {
  const negativeSentiment = feedback.filter(f => f.sentiment === 'negative').length
  const total = feedback.length

  if (negativeSentiment / total > 0.4) {
    await notify({
