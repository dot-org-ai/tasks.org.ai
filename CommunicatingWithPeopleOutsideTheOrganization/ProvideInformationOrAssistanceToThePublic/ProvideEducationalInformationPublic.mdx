### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { provideEducationalInformationPublic } from '@headlessly/provide-educational-information-public'

const education = provideEducationalInformationPublic()

// Develop an educational curriculum
const curriculum = await education.developCurriculum({
  topic: 'Financial Literacy for Seniors',
  targetAudience: 'adults_65_plus',
  modules: [
    'Budget Basics',
    'Avoiding Scams',
    'Investment Fundamentals'

// Auto-distribute materials after instruction
education.instructionDelivered(async ({ workshopId, participants }) => {
  await education.distributeMaterial({
    workshopId,
    recipients: participants,
    materials: ['workbook', 'reference_guide', 'resource_list']
  })
})

// Expand successful programs
education.learningAssessed(async ({ programId, outcomes }) => {
  const avgScore = outcomes.reduce((sum, o) => sum + o.score, 0) / outcomes.length
  if (avgScore > 85 && outcomes.length > 25) {
    await education.expandProgram({
      programId,
      expansion: ['additional_locations', 'online_version']
    })
  }
})
```
