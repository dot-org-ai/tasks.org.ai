## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { reportNewsPublic } from '@headlessly/report-news-public'

const newsroom = reportNewsPublic()

// Gather information for breaking news story
const sources = await newsroom.gatherInformation({
  topic: 'city-council-budget-vote',
  methods: ['interviews', 'documents', 'public-records'],
  sources: [
    { type: 'official', name: 'Council Member Smith' },
    { type: 'expert', name: 'Budget Analyst Johnson' },
    { type: 'document', name: 'Proposed Budget FY2026' }
  ]
})

// Verify facts before publication
const verification = await newsroom.verifyFacts({
  storyId: 'budget-vote-2026',
  claims: [
    'Budget increased by 12%',
    'Vote passed 7-2',
    'New spending on infrastructure'
  ],
  verificationMethods: ['official-records', 'multiple-sources', 'document-review']
})

// Develop and publish story
const story = await newsroom.developStory({
  storyId: 'budget-vote-2026',
  headline: 'City Council Approves 12% Budget Increase',
  content: verifiedContent,
  byline: 'Reporter Jane Doe',
  multimedia: ['council-photo', 'budget-infographic']
})

await newsroom.conductReview({
  storyId: story.id,
  editorId: 'editor-789',
  reviewCriteria: ['accuracy', 'balance', 'clarity', 'legal-compliance']
})

await newsroom.publishNews({
  storyId: story.id,
  channels: ['website', 'mobile-app', 'social-media'],

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-measure reach after publication
newsroom.newsPublished(async ({ storyId }) => {
  setTimeout(async () => {
    await newsroom.measureReach({
      storyId,
      metrics: ['pageviews', 'time-on-page', 'social-shares', 'comments']
    })
  }, 3600000) // 1 hour
})

// Alert editors when corrections are needed
newsroom.factsVerified(async ({ storyId, claims }) => {
  const unverified = claims.filter(c => !c.verified)
  if (unverified.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'editor',
      message: `Story ${storyId} has ${unverified.length} unverified claims requiring review`,
      priority: 'high'
    })
  }
})
