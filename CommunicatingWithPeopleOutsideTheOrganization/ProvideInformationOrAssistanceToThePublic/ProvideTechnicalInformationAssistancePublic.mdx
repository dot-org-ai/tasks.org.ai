## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { provideTechnicalInformationAssistancePublic } from '@headlessly/provide-technical-information-assistance-public'

const techSupport = provideTechnicalInformationAssistancePublic()

// Receive and process technical inquiry
const inquiry = await techSupport.receiveInquiry({
  topic: 'solar-inverter-error-code',
  urgency: 'high',
  inquirerType: 'homeowner',
  contactMethod: 'phone',
  preferredLanguage: 'english'
})

// Translate technical concept
await techSupport.translateConcept({
  inquiryId: inquiry.id,
  technicalTerm: 'grid-synchronization-fault',
  laymanExplanation: 'Your solar system cannot safely connect to the power grid due to voltage mismatch',
  analogies: ['like-plugs-not-matching']
})

// Provide troubleshooting guidance
const troubleshooting = await techSupport.provideTroubleshooting({
  inquiryId: inquiry.id,
  steps: [
    'Check circuit breaker is on',
    'Verify grid power is stable',
    'Reset inverter using shutdown procedure',
    'Monitor for 15 minutes'
  ],
  expectedOutcome: 'inverter-reconnects-automatically',
  escalationCriteria: 'error-persists-after-reset'
})

// Conduct demonstration if needed
if (!troubleshooting.resolved) {
  await techSupport.conductDemonstration({
    inquiryId: inquiry.id,
    format: 'video-call',
    topics: ['inverter-reset-procedure', 'status-indicator-interpretation']
  })
}
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-escalate complex or unresolved issues
techSupport.troubleshootingProvided(async ({ inquiryId, resolved }) => {
  if (!resolved) {
    const inquiry = await techSupport.findInquiries({ id: inquiryId })
    if (inquiry.complexity === 'high') {
      await techSupport.escalateIssue({
        inquiryId,
        specialist: 'senior-technical-engineer',
        priority: 'urgent'
      })
    }
  }
})

// Create documentation for common issues
techSupport.resolutionTracked(async ({ inquiryId, topic }) => {
  const commonIssues = await techSupport.getCommonIssues({ topic })
  if (commonIssues.frequency > 10) {
    await techSupport.createDocumentation({
      topic,
      format: 'FAQ',
      content: commonIssues.resolutionSteps
    })
  }
})
