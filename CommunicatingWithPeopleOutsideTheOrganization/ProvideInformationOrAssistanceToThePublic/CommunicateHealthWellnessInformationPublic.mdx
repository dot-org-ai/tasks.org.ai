## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { communicateHealthWellnessInformationPublic } from '@headlessly/communicate-health-wellness-information-public'

const healthComm = communicateHealthWellnessInformationPublic()

// Develop health message for campaign
const message = await healthComm.developMessage({
  topic: 'diabetes-prevention',
  evidenceBase: ['CDC-guidelines', 'peer-reviewed-studies'],
  keyPoints: ['healthy-eating', 'physical-activity', 'regular-screening']
})

// Adapt for specific audience segments
await healthComm.adaptForAudience({
  messageId: message.id,
  audiences: [
    { segment: 'seniors', adaptations: ['large-print', 'simplified-language'] },
    { segment: 'spanish-speakers', adaptations: ['translation', 'cultural-relevance'] }
  ]
})

// Select channels and distribute
await healthComm.selectChannels({
  campaignId: 'diabetes-prevention-2026',
  channels: ['social-media', 'community-radio', 'clinic-posters', 'text-messages']
})

await healthComm.distributeContent({
  campaignId: 'diabetes-prevention-2026',
  materials: ['infographic', 'video', 'fact-sheet'],
  startDate: '2026-02-15'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Measure impact monthly and adjust messaging
healthComm.contentDistributed(async ({ campaignId }) => {
  setTimeout(async () => {
    const metrics = await healthComm.measureImpact({
      campaignId,
      indicators: ['reach', 'engagement', 'awareness', 'behavior-change']
    })

    if (metrics.awareness < 0.3) {
      await healthComm.updateMessaging({
        campaignId,
        adjustments: ['increase-frequency', 'add-channels', 'simplify-message']
      })
    }
  }, 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // 30 days
})

// Alert when high engagement is detected
healthComm.impactMeasured(async ({ campaignId, metrics }) => {
  if (metrics.engagement > 0.5) {
    await notify({
      to: 'communications-team',
      message: `Campaign ${campaignId} achieving high engagement - consider expanding reach`
    })
