## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { informViewersListenersAudiences } from '@headlessly/inform-viewers-listeners-audiences'

const broadcast = informViewersListenersAudiences()

// Prepare content for broadcast
const content = await broadcast.prepareContent({
  title: 'Monthly Economic Update',
  type: 'live-stream',
  topics: ['employment-data', 'inflation-trends', 'market-outlook'],
  duration: 45,
  presenters: ['chief-economist', 'policy-analyst']
})

// Schedule delivery across multiple channels
await broadcast.scheduleDelivery({
  contentId: content.id,
  channels: ['website-stream', 'youtube', 'facebook-live'],
  broadcastDate: '2026-03-01',
  broadcastTime: '14:00'
})

// Deliver and engage with audience
await broadcast.deliverInformation({
  contentId: content.id,
  interactiveElements: ['live-poll', 'Q&A-session']
})

const metrics = await broadcast.measureReach({
  contentId: content.id,
  platforms: ['website', 'youtube', 'facebook'],
  includeDemographics: true
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-respond to common questions during live broadcasts
broadcast.audienceEngaged(async ({ contentId, questions }) => {
  for (const q of questions) {
    const autoResponse = await matchToFAQ(q.text)
    if (autoResponse) {
      await broadcast.respondToQuestions({
        contentId,
        questionId: q.id,
        response: autoResponse,
        method: 'text-overlay'
      })
    }
  }
})

// Alert when engagement drops below threshold
broadcast.engagementAnalyzed(async ({ contentId, metrics }) => {
  if (metrics.attentionScore < 0.6) {
    await notify({
      to: 'content-director',
      message: `Low engagement for ${contentId} - consider adjusting delivery approach`
    })
  }
})
