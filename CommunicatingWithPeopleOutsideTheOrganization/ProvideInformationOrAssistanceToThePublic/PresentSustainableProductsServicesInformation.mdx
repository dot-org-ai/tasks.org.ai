## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { presentSustainableProductsServicesInformation } from '@headlessly/present-sustainable-products-services-information'

const greenMarketing = presentSustainableProductsServicesInformation()

// Explain sustainable product benefits
await greenMarketing.explainBenefits({
  productId: 'solar-panel-system',
  benefits: [
    'reduces-carbon-emissions',
    'lowers-energy-costs',
    'increases-property-value',
    'supports-grid-independence'
  ],
  audience: 'homeowners',
  deliveryChannels: ['website', 'showroom', 'webinar']
})

// Verify certifications and demonstrate impact
const certifications = await greenMarketing.verifyCertifications({
  productId: 'solar-panel-system',
  certifications: ['Energy-Star', 'NABCEP', 'ISO-14001']
})

const impact = await greenMarketing.demonstrateImpact({
  productId: 'solar-panel-system',
  metrics: {
    carbonOffset: '6-tons-per-year',
    energyGeneration: '8000-kWh-per-year',
    paybackPeriod: '7-years',
    lifespan: '25-years'
  }
})

// Compare to conventional alternative
await greenMarketing.compareAlternatives({
  sustainableOption: 'solar-panel-system',
  conventionalOption: 'grid-electricity',
  comparisonMetrics: ['cost', 'emissions', 'reliability', 'maintenance']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-address common concerns about cost
greenMarketing.concernsAddressed(async ({ productId, concern }) => {
  if (concern.topic === 'upfront-cost') {
    await provideIncentiveInfo({
      productId,
      incentives: ['federal-tax-credit', 'state-rebate', 'financing-options']
    })
  }
})

// Track adoption trends and adjust messaging
greenMarketing.awarenessMeasured(async ({ productCategory, metrics }) => {
  if (metrics.awareness > 0.7 && metrics.adoption < 0.2) {
    await notify({
      to: 'marketing-team',
      message: `High awareness but low adoption for ${productCategory} - consider addressing barriers`
    })
  }
})
```
