## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { scheduleDiningReservations } from '@headlessly/schedule-dining-reservations'

const dining = scheduleDiningReservations()

// Check availability for dinner
const slots = await dining.checkAvailability({
  date: '2026-03-21',
  partySize: 4,
  mealPeriod: 'dinner',
  preferredTime: '19:00'
})

// Create a reservation
const reservation = await dining.createReservation({
  guestName: 'Thompson',
  date: '2026-03-21',
  time: '19:00',
  partySize: 4,
  preferences: {
    seating: 'patio',
    occasion: 'anniversary',
    dietary: ['gluten-free']
  }
})

// Assign a specific table
await dining.assignTable({
  reservationId: reservation.id,
  tableId: 'patio-12',
  section: 'outdoor'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Send confirmation to guest when reservation is created
dining.reservationCreated(async ({ reservationId, guestContact, date, time }) => {
  await notify({
    to: guestContact,
    method: 'sms',
    message: `Your reservation for ${date} at ${time} is confirmed. Ref: ${reservationId}`
  })
})

// Auto-advance waitlist when cancellations occur
dining.reservationCancelled(async ({ date, timeSlot, partySize }) => {
  const waitlist = await dining.getWaitlist({ date, minPartySize: partySize })
  if (waitlist.length > 0) {
    await dining.createReservation({
      guestName: waitlist[0].guestName,
      date,
      time: timeSlot,
      partySize: waitlist[0].partySize
    })
  }
})
```
