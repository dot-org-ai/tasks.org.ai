## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { scheduleAppointments } from '@headlessly/schedule-appointments'

const appointments = scheduleAppointments()

// Check available slots
const slots = await appointments.checkAvailability({
  providerId: 'provider-301',
  date: '2026-02-12',
  duration: 60
})

// Book an appointment
const appointment = await appointments.bookAppointment({
  requestorId: 'client-892',
  providerId: 'provider-301',
  timeSlot: slots[0],
  type: 'consultation',
  notes: 'Initial assessment meeting'
})

// Send a reminder 24 hours before
await appointments.sendReminder({
  appointmentId: appointment.id,
  channel: 'sms',
  advanceMinutes: 1440
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Promote waitlisted requestors when a cancellation occurs
appointments.appointmentCancelled(async ({ providerId, timeSlot }) => {
  const waitlist = await appointments.getWaitlist({ providerId })
  if (waitlist.length > 0) {
    await appointments.bookAppointment({
      requestorId: waitlist[0].requestorId,
      providerId,
      timeSlot
    })
  }
})

// Auto-send reminders when an appointment is booked
appointments.appointmentBooked(async ({ appointmentId, requestorId }) => {
  await appointments.sendReminder({
    appointmentId,
    channel: 'email',
    advanceMinutes: 1440
  })
})
```
