## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { scheduleAppointmentsProspectiveCustomers } from '@headlessly/schedule-appointments-prospective-customers'

const scheduler = scheduleAppointmentsProspectiveCustomers()

// Qualify a prospect before scheduling
const qualification = await scheduler.qualifyProspect({
  prospectId: 'prospect-4821',
  criteria: { budget: true, authority: true, need: true, timeline: 'Q1' }
})

// Check availability and book the appointment
const slots = await scheduler.checkAvailability({
  representativeId: 'rep-112',
  dateRange: { start: '2026-02-10', end: '2026-02-14' },
  duration: 30
})

const appointment = await scheduler.bookAppointment({
  prospectId: 'prospect-4821',
  representativeId: 'rep-112',
  timeSlot: slots[0],
  agenda: { topics: ['Product demo', 'Pricing discussion'] }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Send reminder when appointment is confirmed
scheduler.appointmentBooked(async ({ appointmentId, prospectId, timeSlot }) => {
  await sendReminder({
    to: prospectId,
    message: `Your meeting is confirmed for ${timeSlot.start}`,
    channel: 'email'
  })
})

// Re-engage prospects who cancel
scheduler.appointmentCancelled(async ({ prospectId, reason }) => {
  await scheduler.initiateOutreach({
    prospectId,
    channel: 'email',
    template: 'reschedule-followup',
    delay: '3d'
  })
})
```
