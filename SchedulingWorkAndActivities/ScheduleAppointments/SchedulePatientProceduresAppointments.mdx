## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { schedulePatientProceduresAppointments } from '@headlessly/schedule-patient-procedures-appointments'

const scheduling = schedulePatientProceduresAppointments()

// Check provider availability
const slots = await scheduling.checkProviderAvailability({
  providerId: 'dr-patel',
  specialty: 'orthopedics',
  dateRange: { start: '2026-04-01', end: '2026-04-15' },
  duration: 30
})

// Book a consultation appointment
const appointment = await scheduling.bookAppointment({
  patientId: 'patient-5567',
  providerId: 'dr-patel',
  type: 'consultation',
  date: '2026-04-03',
  time: '14:00',
  reason: 'Knee pain evaluation'
})

// Request pre-authorization for a follow-up procedure
await scheduling.requestPreAuthorization({
  appointmentId: appointment.id,
  procedureCode: 'CPT-29881',
  insurerId: 'ins-bluecross',
  policyNumber: 'BC-449821'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Send reminders 48 hours before appointments
scheduling.appointmentBooked(async ({ appointmentId, date, patientContact }) => {
  const reminderDate = subtractHours(date, 48)
  schedule.at(reminderDate, async () => {
    await scheduling.sendReminder({
      appointmentId,
      method: 'sms',
      contact: patientContact
    })
  })
})

// Notify coordinator when pre-auth is denied
scheduling.preAuthorizationDenied(async ({ appointmentId, reason, procedureCode }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'clinical-coordinator',
    message: `Pre-auth denied for appointment ${appointmentId} (${procedureCode}): ${reason}. Reschedule or appeal required.`
  })
})
```
