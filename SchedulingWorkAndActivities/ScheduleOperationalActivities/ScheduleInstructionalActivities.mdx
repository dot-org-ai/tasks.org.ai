## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { scheduleInstructionalActivities } from '@headlessly/schedule-instructional-activities'

const scheduler = scheduleInstructionalActivities()

// Create a new lecture session
const session = await scheduler.createSession({
  courseId: 'CS-301',
  title: 'Data Structures - Lecture 12',
  dateTime: '2026-03-15T10:00:00',
  duration: 90,
  capacity: 40
})

// Assign instructor and reserve room
await scheduler.assignInstructor({
  sessionId: session.id,
  instructorId: 'prof-martinez'
})

await scheduler.reserveRoom({
  sessionId: session.id,
  roomId: 'HALL-204',
  setup: 'lecture'
})

// Check for conflicts before publishing
const conflicts = await scheduler.detectConflicts({ timetableId: 'fall-2026' })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify students when sessions are rescheduled
scheduler.sessionRescheduled(async ({ sessionId, oldTime, newTime, roomId }) => {
  const enrollments = await scheduler.findSessions({ sessionId })
  await notify({
    to: enrollments.studentIds,
    message: `Session moved from ${oldTime} to ${newTime} in room ${roomId}`
  })
})

// Auto-resolve conflicts by suggesting alternative slots
scheduler.conflictDetected(async ({ sessionId, conflictType }) => {
  const alternatives = await scheduler.getRoomAvailability({
    date: conflict.date,
    duration: conflict.duration
  })
  await scheduler.rescheduleSession({
    sessionId,
    newSlot: alternatives[0]
  })
})
```
