## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { scheduleRepairInstallationMaintenanceActivities } from '@headlessly/schedule-repair-installation-maintenance-activities'

const service = scheduleRepairInstallationMaintenanceActivities()

// Create a new installation service order
const order = await service.createServiceOrder({
  type: 'installation',
  customerId: 'cust-4521',
  description: 'Install commercial HVAC unit - rooftop',
  priority: 'high',
  siteAddress: '1200 Industrial Blvd, Suite 300'
})

// Schedule and confirm
await service.scheduleJob({
  orderId: order.id,
  technicianId: 'tech-nguyen',
  date: '2026-03-20',
  timeSlot: '08:00-12:00'
})

await service.confirmAppointment({
  orderId: order.id,

// Auto-dispatch when appointment is confirmed
service.appointmentConfirmed(async ({ orderId, technicianId, date }) => {
  await service.dispatchTechnician({
    orderId,
    technicianId,
    routingPriority: 'optimal'
  })
})

// Alert scheduler when jobs are rescheduled multiple times
service.jobRescheduled(async ({ orderId, rescheduleCount }) => {
  if (rescheduleCount >= 3) {
    await notify({
      to: 'service-manager',
      message: `Service order ${orderId} has been rescheduled ${rescheduleCount} times. Review required.`
    })
  }
})
```
