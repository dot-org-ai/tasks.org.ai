# Research Energy Production Use Conservation

> Business-as-Code definition for energy systems research. Models investigation of generation technologies, consumption patterns, efficiency improvements, and conservation strategies.

## Overview

Energy research involves studying power generation methods, transmission systems, consumption patterns, efficiency technologies, and conservation practices. This definition exposes actions for generation analysis, consumption monitoring, efficiency assessment, and conservation planning, with searches for tracking energy performance and optimization opportunities.

## Actors

| UtilityCompany | Generates and distributes electrical power |
| IndustrialConsumer | Uses significant energy in manufacturing operations |
| RegulatoryCommission | Oversees energy markets and standards |
| EquipmentManufacturer | Produces energy generation and efficiency technologies |
| EnergyConsultant | Advises on optimization and conservation |
| GridOperator | Manages transmission and distribution infrastructure |

## Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| EnergyResearcher | Investigates generation and conservation technologies |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { researchEnergyProductionUseConservation } from '@headlessly/research-energy-production-use-conservation'

const research = researchEnergyProductionUseConservation()

// Benchmark baseline energy consumption
const baseline = await research.benchmarkBaseline({
  facility: 'Manufacturing Plant A',
  period: '2025',
  consumption: {
    total: 15000000,
    electricity: 12000000,
    naturalGas: 3000000
  },
  costPerKwh: 0.12
})

// Monitor consumption patterns
await research.monitorConsumption({
  facilityId: baseline.facilityId,
  interval: 'hourly',
  duration: 90,
  systems: ['hvac', 'lighting', 'production-equipment', 'compressed-air']
})

// Analyze generation options
await research.analyzeGeneration({
  facilityId: baseline.facilityId,
  technologies: [
    { type: 'rooftop-solar', capacity: 500 },
    { type: 'natural-gas-cogeneration', capacity: 2000 }
  ],
  criteria: ['efficiency', 'cost', 'emissions']
})

// Assess efficiency improvements
const efficiency = await research.assessEfficiency({
  facilityId: baseline.facilityId,
  measures: [
    { category: 'lighting', technology: 'LED-retrofit', cost: 50000 },
    { category: 'hvac', technology: 'variable-speed-drives', cost: 120000 }
  ]
})

// Project savings from conservation
await research.projectSavings({
  facilityId: baseline.facilityId,
  interventions: efficiency.measures,
  timeframe: 10,
  assumedCostIncrease: 0.03
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert management when significant savings are projected
research.savingsProjected(async ({ facilityId, annualSavings, paybackPeriod }) => {
  if (annualSavings > 100000 && paybackPeriod < 3) {
    await notify({
      to: 'facility-manager',
      template: 'high-value-efficiency-opportunity',
      data: { facilityId, savings: annualSavings, payback: paybackPeriod }
    })
  }
})

// Trigger conservation planning when consumption exceeds baseline
research.consumptionMonitored(async ({ facilityId, currentConsumption, baseline }) => {
  if (currentConsumption > baseline * 1.1) {
    await research.planConservation({ facilityId, urgency: 'high' })
  }
})
```
