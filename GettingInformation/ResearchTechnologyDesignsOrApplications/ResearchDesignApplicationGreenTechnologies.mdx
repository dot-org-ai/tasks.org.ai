## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { researchDesignApplicationGreenTechnologies } from '@headlessly/research-design-application-green-technologies'

const research = researchDesignApplicationGreenTechnologies()

// Assess a new green technology
const tech = await research.assessTechnology({
  name: 'Algae-Based Bioplastic',
  category: 'sustainable-materials',
  characteristics: {
    biodegradability: 'complete within 90 days',
    renewableContent: 0.95,
    productionEnergy: 'solar-powered'
  }
})

// Analyze environmental impact
const impact = await research.analyzeImpact({
  technologyId: tech.id,
  scope: 'cradle-to-grave',
  metrics: {
    carbonFootprint: -15,
    waterUsage: 0.3,
    landUse: 2.5,
    toxicity: 'minimal'
  }
})

// Design pilot project
await research.designPilot({
  technologyId: tech.id,
  location: 'coastal facility',
  scale: 'small',
  duration: 12,
  partners: ['local-municipality', 'university-lab']
})

// Measure performance
await research.measurePerformance({
  technologyId: tech.id,
  period: 'Q1-2026',
  outcomes: {
    emissionsReduced: 25,
    materialsRecovered: 0.88,
    costPerUnit: 1.2
  }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert funding agencies when scalability is developed
research.scalabilityDeveloped(async ({ technologyId, scalabilityPlan }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'investment-fund',
    template: 'scalability-plan-ready',
    data: { technologyId, plan: scalabilityPlan }
  })
})

// Trigger compliance certification after successful pilot
research.performanceMeasured(async ({ technologyId, outcomes }) => {
  if (outcomes.emissionsReduced > 20) {
    await research.certifyCompliance({ technologyId })
  }
})
```
