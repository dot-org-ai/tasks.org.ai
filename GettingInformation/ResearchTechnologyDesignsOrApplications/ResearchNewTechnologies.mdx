## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { researchNewTechnologies } from '@headlessly/research-new-technologies'

const research = researchNewTechnologies()

// Scan for new technologies across multiple domains
const scan = await research.scanTechnologies({
  domains: ['artificial-intelligence', 'quantum-computing', 'biotechnology'],
  sources: [
    { type: 'patent-database', regions: ['US', 'EU', 'CN'] },
    { type: 'academic-journal', databases: ['ArXiv', 'Nature', 'Science'] },
    { type: 'startup-directory', platforms: ['Crunchbase', 'AngelList'] }
  ],
  timeframe: '2026-Q1'
})

// Assess impact of identified technologies
await research.assessImpact({
  technologyId: 'tech-ai-142',
  name: 'Multimodal Foundation Models',
  dimensions: {
    disruptivePotential: 'high',
    timeToMainstream: 24,
    marketSize: 85000000000,
    competitiveAdvantage: 'moderate-to-high'
  }
})

// Track adoption signals
await research.trackSignals({
  technologyId: 'tech-ai-142',
  signals: [
    { type: 'funding-round', amount: 200000000, stage: 'series-C' },
    { type: 'enterprise-pilot', count: 45, industries: ['finance', 'healthcare'] },
    { type: 'patent-filing', count: 120, jurisdictions: ['US', 'EU'] },
    { type: 'academic-citation', count: 3500, yearOverYear: 2.8 }
  ]
})

// Analyze market trends
const trends = await research.analyzeTrends({
  technologyCategory: 'generative-ai',
  period: '2024-2026',
  metrics: {
    adoptionRate: 0.35,
    investmentGrowth: 1.8,
    enterpriseDeployments: 8500,
    revenueGrowth: 2.2
  }
})

// Map competitive landscape
await research.mapCompetitors({
  technologyId: 'tech-ai-142',
  competitors: [
    { organization: 'BigTech-A', capability: 'leader', investment: 'high' },
    { organization: 'Startup-B', capability: 'innovator', investment: 'moderate' },
    { organization: 'Enterprise-C', capability: 'follower', investment: 'low' }
  ]
})

// Recommend strategy based on analysis
await research.recommendStrategy({
  technologyId: 'tech-ai-142',
  recommendation: 'strategic-investment',
  rationale: 'high disruptive potential with moderate time to mainstream',
  actions: ['pilot-deployment', 'partnership-exploration', 'talent-acquisition'],
  timeline: 18
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert executives when high-impact technology is identified
research.impactAssessed(async ({ technologyId, dimensions }) => {
  if (dimensions.disruptivePotential === 'high' && dimensions.timeToMainstream < 36) {
    await notify({
      to: 'executive-team',
      template: 'high-impact-technology-identified',
      data: { technologyId, impact: dimensions }
    })
  }
})

// Trigger competitive mapping when strong adoption signals detected
research.signalsTracked(async ({ technologyId, signals }) => {
  const strongSignals = signals.filter(s =>
    (s.type === 'enterprise-pilot' && s.count > 30) ||
    (s.type === 'funding-round' && s.amount > 100000000)
  )
  if (strongSignals.length > 0) {
    await research.mapCompetitors({ technologyId })
  }
})
```
