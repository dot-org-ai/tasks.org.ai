## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { researchEngineeringApplicationsEmergingTechnologies } from '@headlessly/research-engineering-applications-emerging-technologies'

const research = researchEngineeringApplicationsEmergingTechnologies()

// Scout a new emerging technology
const tech = await research.scoutTechnology({
  name: 'Quantum Computing for Optimization',
  field: 'quantum-information',
  source: 'MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab',
  discoveryDate: '2026-01-15',
  potentialImpact: 'high'
})

// Assess technology readiness
const readiness = await research.assessReadiness({
  technologyId: tech.id,
  trl: 5,
  criteria: {
    componentValidation: true,
    subsystemIntegration: false,
    systemPrototype: false
  }
})

// Evaluate feasibility for engineering application
await research.evaluateFeasibility({
  technologyId: tech.id,
  technical: {
    maturity: 'laboratory-proven',
    complexity: 'high',
    dependencies: ['cryogenic-systems', 'quantum-error-correction']
  },
  commercial: {
    costEstimate: 5000000,
    timeToMarket: 36,
    competitiveLandscape: 'emerging'
  }
})

// Develop application scenario
await research.developApplication({
  technologyId: tech.id,
  useCase: 'supply-chain-optimization',
  domain: 'logistics',
  expectedBenefit: 'reduce routing costs by 30%',
  constraints: ['hardware-availability', 'algorithm-development']
})

// Plan integration strategy
await research.planIntegration({
  technologyId: tech.id,
  approach: 'phased-pilot',
  phases: [
    { name: 'proof-of-concept', duration: 6 },
    { name: 'limited-deployment', duration: 12 },
    { name: 'full-production', duration: 18 }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert stakeholders when high-impact technology is scouted
research.technologyScouted(async ({ technologyId, potentialImpact }) => {
  if (potentialImpact === 'high') {
    await notify({
      to: ['venture-capital', 'industry-consortium'],
      template: 'high-impact-technology-identified',
      data: { technologyId }
    })
  }
})

// Trigger integration planning when application is developed
research.applicationDeveloped(async ({ technologyId, expectedBenefit }) => {
  const feasibility = await research.getFeasibilityAssessments({ technologyId })
  if (feasibility.commercial.timeToMarket < 48) {
    await research.planIntegration({ technologyId })
  }
})
```
