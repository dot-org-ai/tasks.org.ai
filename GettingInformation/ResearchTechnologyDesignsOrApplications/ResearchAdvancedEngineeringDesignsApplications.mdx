## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { researchAdvancedEngineeringDesignsApplications } from '@headlessly/research-advanced-engineering-designs-applications'

const research = researchAdvancedEngineeringDesignsApplications()

// Explore a novel structural concept
const concept = await research.exploreConcept({
  name: 'Self-Healing Composite Structures',
  domain: 'aerospace',
  novelty: 'embedded microcapsule healing agents',
  theoreticalBasis: 'polymer chemistry and fracture mechanics'
})

// Assess feasibility
const feasibility = await research.assessFeasibility({
  conceptId: concept.id,
  criteria: {
    technical: ['material availability', 'manufacturing complexity'],
    economic: ['cost per unit', 'development timeline'],
    regulatory: ['airworthiness certification']
  }
})

// Model design performance
await research.modelDesign({
  conceptId: concept.id,
  simulationType: 'finite-element-analysis',
  parameters: {
    loadConditions: 'fatigue cycling',
    environmentalFactors: ['temperature', 'humidity'],
    iterations: 10000
  }
})

// Evaluate prototype
await research.evaluatePrototype({
  conceptId: concept.id,
  testType: 'accelerated-life-testing',
  results: {
    healingEfficiency: 0.85,
    strengthRetention: 0.92,
    cyclesBeforeFailure: 50000
  }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert stakeholders when innovation is documented
research.innovationDocumented(async ({ conceptId, innovationType }) => {
  await notify({
    to: ['patent-office', 'industry-partners'],
    template: 'innovation-disclosure',
    data: { conceptId, type: innovationType }
  })
})

// Trigger application identification after validation
research.performanceValidated(async ({ conceptId, performanceMetrics }) => {
  if (performanceMetrics.overallScore > 0.8) {
    await research.identifyApplications({ conceptId })
  }
})
```
