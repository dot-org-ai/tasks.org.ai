> Business-as-Code definition for social issues research. Models the investigation, analysis, and documentation of societal challenges and trends.

## Overview

Social issues research involves systematic investigation of societal challenges, demographic trends, policy impacts, and community needs. This definition exposes actions for study design, data collection, stakeholder engagement, and findings dissemination, along with searches for tracking research progress and outcomes.

| FundingAgency | Provides grants and financial support for research |
| AdvocacyGroup | Partners in research and applies findings |
| AcademicInstitution | Provides research infrastructure and ethical review |
| MediaOutlet | Disseminates research findings to public audiences |

## Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| PrincipalInvestigator | Leads research design and execution |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { conductResearchSocialIssues } from '@headlessly/conduct-research-social-issues'

const research = conductResearchSocialIssues()

// Define a new research project
const project = await research.defineResearch({
  title: 'Housing Insecurity in Urban Communities',
  questions: [
    'What factors contribute to housing instability?',
    'How do communities adapt to displacement risk?'
  ],
  duration: 18,
  fundingSource: 'National Science Foundation'
})

// Design study methodology
await research.designStudy({
  projectId: project.id,
  methodology: 'mixed-methods',
  sampling: 'stratified random sample',
  sampleSize: 500,
  dataCollection: ['survey', 'focus-group', 'case-study']
})

// Collect data from community members
await research.collectData({
  projectId: project.id,
  method: 'survey',
  participants: 450,
  completionRate: 0.9,
  dataPoints: 12500
})

// Analyze and validate findings
const analysis = await research.analyzeData({
  projectId: project.id,
  techniques: ['regression', 'thematic-analysis']
})

await research.validateFindings({
  projectId: project.id,
  reviewers: ['peer-expert', 'community-member'],
  significance: 0.05
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify stakeholders when report is published
research.reportPublished(async ({ projectId, reportUrl }) => {
  const project = await research.findProjects({ id: projectId })
  await notify({
    to: project.stakeholders,
    template: 'research-report-available',
    data: { title: project.title, url: reportUrl }
  })
})

// Alert ethics officer if sensitive data collected
research.dataCollected(async ({ projectId, method, participants }) => {
  if (method === 'interview' && participants > 100) {
    await notify({
      to: 'ethics-officer',
      message: `Review required for large interview dataset in project ${projectId}`
    })
  }
})
```
