# Conduct Historical Research

> Business-as-Code definition for conducting historical research. Models the complete research process from archival investigation through primary source analysis, interpretation, and scholarly publication.

## Overview

Historical research involves locating primary sources, analyzing documents, contextualizing evidence, and constructing narratives about past events and societies. This definition exposes actions for archival research, source criticism, historical interpretation, and scholarly writing across time periods and geographic regions.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { conductHistoricalResearch } from '@headlessly/conduct-historical-research'

const research = conductHistoricalResearch()

// Locate archival sources for research project
const sources = await research.locateSources({
  topic: 'Industrial Labor Movement 1890-1920',
  region: 'Northeastern United States',
  sourceTypes: ['union records', 'company correspondence', 'newspaper articles', 'government reports'],
  repositories: ['National Archives', 'Tamiment Library', 'state historical societies']
})

// Examine primary source documents
const examination = await research.examineDocuments({
  sourceIds: sources.collections.map(c => c.id),
  focus: ['labor organizing', 'strike activity', 'working conditions', 'management responses'],
  methods: ['transcription', 'photography', 'note-taking']
})

// Authenticate historical evidence
const authentication = await research.authenticateEvidence({
  documentIds: examination.documents.map(d => d.id),
  checks: ['provenance verification', 'handwriting analysis', 'cross-reference with known events'],
  standards: 'archival best practices'
})

// Contextualize findings within historical period
const context = await research.contextualizeFindings({
  authenticatedDocs: authentication.verified,
  factors: [
    'economic conditions',
    'political climate',
    'social movements',
    'technological changes',
    'legal framework'
  ],
  secondarySources: ['scholarly monographs', 'contemporary accounts']
})

// Construct historical narrative
const narrative = await research.constructNarrative({
  contextId: context.id,
  structure: 'chronological with thematic chapters',
  argument: 'Labor activism transformed industrial relations despite fierce opposition',
  chapters: [
    'Early Organizing Efforts',
    'Strike Wave of 1902',
    'Management Counter-offensive',
    'Legal Battles',
    'Legacy and Impact'
  ]
})

// Interpret historical significance
await research.interpretSignificance({
  narrativeId: narrative.id,
  themes: ['worker agency', 'class conflict', 'institutional change', 'social justice'],
  historiographicalDebate: 'revisionist vs traditional labor history'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert when authentication fails for important documents
research.evidenceAuthenticated(async ({ documentId, verified, concerns }) => {
  if (!verified && concerns.includes('potential forgery')) {
    await notify({
      to: 'research-team',
      priority: 'high',
      message: `Document ${documentId} failed authentication - potential forgery detected`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-submit completed manuscripts for peer review
research.narrativeConstructed(async ({ narrativeId, wordCount, status }) => {
  if (status === 'complete' && wordCount > 80000) {
    await research.publishScholarship({
      narrativeId,
      venue: 'university press',
      submissionType: 'book manuscript',
      peerReview: true
    })
  }
})
```
