# Research Microbiological Chemical Processes Structures

> Business-as-Code definition for microbiology and biochemistry research. Models investigation of microbial metabolism, cellular structures, enzymatic reactions, and chemical transformations in biological systems.

## Overview

Microbiological and chemical process research examines metabolic pathways, cellular architecture, protein structure, and biochemical mechanisms in microorganisms and cell systems. This definition provides actions for culturing microbes, characterizing metabolites, resolving structures, and elucidating biochemical pathways across diverse microbial and molecular systems.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { researchMicrobiologicalChemicalProcessesStructures } from '@headlessly/research-microbiological-chemical-processes-structures'

const research = researchMicrobiologicalChemicalProcessesStructures()

// Begin study of novel antibiotic-producing bacterium
const strain = await research.cultureMicrobe({
  organism: 'Streptomyces sp.',
  isolationSource: 'soil_sample_rainforest',
  medium: 'actinomycete_isolation_agar',
  temperature: 28,
  incubationDays: 14
})

// Map biosynthetic pathway for antibiotic compound
const pathway = await research.elucidatePathway({
  strainId: strain.id,
  targetCompound: 'novel_polyketide',
  methods: ['gene_cluster_analysis', 'feeding_studies', 'intermediate_isolation']
})

// Optimize production through metabolic engineering
const optimized = await research.engineerStrain({
  strainId: strain.id,
  modifications: ['overexpress_biosynthetic_genes', 'knockout_competing_pathway'],
  targetImprovement: 'increase_yield'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Automatically resolve structure when novel metabolite is found
research.metaboliteIdentified(async ({ strainId, compound, novelty }) => {
  if (novelty === 'previously_unknown') {
    await research.resolveStructure({
      compound,
      methods: ['nmr_spectroscopy', 'mass_spectrometry', 'x-ray_crystallography']
    })
  }
})

// Request process optimization when engineered strain shows promise
research.strainEngineered(async ({ strainId, yieldImprovement }) => {
  if (yieldImprovement > 2.0) {
    await research.optimizeProcess({
      strainId,
      parameters: ['growth_conditions', 'feeding_strategy', 'extraction_method']
    })
  }
})
```
