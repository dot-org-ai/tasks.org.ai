# Research Genetic Characteristics Expression

> Business-as-Code definition for researching genetic characteristics and gene expression patterns. Models the complete research process from genome sequencing through functional genomics and trait association studies.

## Overview

Genetic research involves sequencing genomes, identifying genes, analyzing expression patterns, and linking genetic variation to phenotypic traits. This definition exposes actions for genomic analysis, transcriptomics, gene editing experiments, and heredity studies across organisms and populations.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { researchGeneticCharacteristicsExpression } from '@headlessly/research-genetic-characteristics-expression'

const genetics = researchGeneticCharacteristicsExpression()

// Sequence a novel organism genome
const genome = await genetics.sequenceGenome({
  organism: 'Arabidopsis thaliana',
  accession: 'Col-0',
  sequencingPlatform: 'Illumina NovaSeq',
  coverage: '50x',
  assemblyMethod: 'de novo'
})

// Identify genes and functional elements
const annotation = await genetics.identifyGenes({
  genomeId: genome.id,
  methods: ['ab initio prediction', 'homology search', 'RNA-seq evidence'],
  databases: ['UniProt', 'NCBI RefSeq']
})

// Measure gene expression under stress conditions
const expression = await genetics.measureExpression({
  genomeId: genome.id,
  conditions: ['control', 'drought stress', 'heat stress'],
  technology: 'RNA-seq',
  replicates: 3
})

// Detect genetic variants in population
const variants = await genetics.detectVariants({
  genomeId: genome.id,
  population: 'natural accessions',
  sampleSize: 1000,
  variantTypes: ['SNP', 'indel', 'CNV']
})

// Associate variants with phenotypic traits
await genetics.associateTraits({
  variantSetId: variants.id,
  traits: ['flowering time', 'disease resistance', 'yield'],
  method: 'GWAS',
  significance: 5e-8
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert when disease-associated variant is detected
genetics.variantsDetected(async ({ variantSetId, variants, population }) => {
  const pathogenic = variants.filter(v => v.clinicalSignificance === 'pathogenic')
  if (pathogenic.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'genetic-counseling-team',
      message: `${pathogenic.length} pathogenic variants detected in population ${population}`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-initiate functional studies for high-impact associations
genetics.traitsAssociated(async ({ gene, trait, significance, effect }) => {
  if (significance < 1e-10 && Math.abs(effect) > 2) {
    await genetics.editGene({
      geneId: gene.id,
      method: 'CRISPR-Cas9',
      modification: 'knockout',
      purpose: 'validate trait association'
    })
  }
})
```
