## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { collectInformationAboutClients } from '@headlessly/collect-information-about-clients'

const clients = collectInformationAboutClients()

// Initiate client intake
const intake = await clients.initiateIntake({
  clientId: 'client-74829',
  intakeType: 'social-services',
  referralSource: 'community-center',
  urgency: 'standard'
})

// Conduct initial interview
const interview = await clients.conductInterview({
  intakeId: intake.id,
  interviewer: 'intake-specialist-3',
  responses: {
    housingStatus: 'unstable-rental',
    employmentStatus: 'part-time',
    dependents: 2,
    primaryNeed: 'housing-assistance',
    secondaryNeeds: ['childcare', 'job-training']
  }
})

// Request supporting documents
await clients.requestDocuments({
  intakeId: intake.id,
  documents: ['proof-of-income', 'rental-agreement', 'birth-certificates'],
  deadline: '2026-02-12T17:00:00Z'
})

// Assess client needs
const assessment = await clients.assessNeeds({
  clientId: 'client-74829',
  assessmentType: 'comprehensive',
  evaluator: 'case-manager-7',
  findings: {
    housingPriority: 'high',
    recommendedServices: ['emergency-rental-assistance', 'employment-counseling']
  }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-request documents after interview completion
clients.interviewConducted(async ({ intakeId, responses }) => {
  const requiredDocs = determineRequiredDocuments(responses)
  await clients.requestDocuments({
    intakeId,
    documents: requiredDocs,
    deadline: new Date(Date.now() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000).toISOString()
  })
})

// Trigger needs assessment when verification complete
clients.informationVerified(async ({ intakeId }) => {
  const intake = await clients.findClients({ intakeId })
  if (intake.documentsComplete) {
    await clients.assessNeeds({
      clientId: intake.clientId,
      assessmentType: 'comprehensive'
    })
  }
})
```
