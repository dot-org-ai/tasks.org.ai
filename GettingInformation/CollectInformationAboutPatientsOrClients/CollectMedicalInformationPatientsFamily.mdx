## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { collectMedicalInformationPatientsFamily } from '@headlessly/collect-medical-information-patients-family'

const collection = collectMedicalInformationPatientsFamily()

// Conduct patient interview and document symptoms
const interview = await collection.conductPatientInterview({
  patientId: 'PT-89234',
  interviewDate: '2026-02-05T09:30:00Z',
  chiefComplaint: 'persistent headaches and dizziness',
  reviewOfSystems: { neurological: 'headaches, dizziness', cardiovascular: 'none' }
})

await collection.documentSymptoms({
  patientId: 'PT-89234',
  symptoms: [
    { description: 'bilateral frontal headache', severity: 7, duration: '2 weeks' },
    { description: 'intermittent vertigo', severity: 5, duration: '1 week' }
  ]
})

// Request family medical history
await collection.requestFamilyHistory({
  patientId: 'PT-89234',
  familyContact: { name: 'Maria Rodriguez', relationship: 'daughter', phone: '555-0142' }
})

// Retrieve records from referring physician
const records = await collection.retrieveRecords({
  patientId: 'PT-89234',
  providerId: 'PROV-5821',
  recordTypes: ['clinical-notes', 'lab-results', 'imaging']
})

// Verify current medications
await collection.verifyMedications({
  patientId: 'PT-89234',
  pharmacyId: 'PHARM-3012',
  confirmationMethod: 'electronic'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Trigger consolidation when all records are received
collection.recordsRetrieved(async ({ patientId }) => {
  await collection.consolidateInformation({ patientId })
})

// Alert clinician when family history reveals critical conditions
collection.familyHistoryReceived(async ({ patientId, conditions }) => {
  const criticalConditions = conditions.filter(c => c.severity === 'high')
  if (criticalConditions.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'assigned-clinician',
      message: `Critical family history identified for patient ${patientId}: ${criticalConditions.map(c => c.name).join(', ')}`
    })
  }
})

// Validate data completeness before clinical review
collection.informationConsolidated(async ({ patientId }) => {
  await collection.validateData({ patientId })
})
```
