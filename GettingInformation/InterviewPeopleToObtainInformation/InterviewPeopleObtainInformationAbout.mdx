## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { interviewPeopleObtainInformationAbout } from '@headlessly/interview-people-obtain-information-about'

const verificationInterviews = interviewPeopleObtainInformationAbout()

// Identify references for employment verification
const references = await verificationInterviews.identifyReference({
  subjectId: 'SUBJ-8421',
  investigationType: 'employment-background',
  referenceTypes: ['supervisor', 'hr-representative', 'colleague'],
  minimumReferences: 3
})

// Contact former employer reference
await verificationInterviews.contactReference({
  referenceId: references[0].id,
  contactMethod: 'phone',
  purpose: 'employment-verification',
  consentObtained: true
})

// Conduct verification interview
const verification = await verificationInterviews.conductVerification({
  referenceId: references[0].id,
  subjectId: 'SUBJ-8421',
  verificationAreas: ['employment-dates', 'job-title', 'responsibilities', 'performance', 'reason-for-leaving'],
  recordingMethod: 'notes'
})

// Assess character based on reference input
const assessment = await verificationInterviews.assessCharacter({
  subjectId: 'SUBJ-8421',
  referenceId: references[0].id,
  assessmentCriteria: {
    reliability: 'consistently-met-deadlines',
    integrity: 'trustworthy-with-confidential-information',
    teamwork: 'collaborative-and-supportive',
    judgement: 'made-sound-decisions-under-pressure'
  },
  overallRating: 'highly-favorable'
})

// Verify educational credentials
await verificationInterviews.verifyCredentials({
  subjectId: 'SUBJ-8421',
  institution: 'State University',
  credentialType: 'bachelors-degree',
  claimedDegree: 'BS Computer Science',
  claimedGraduationDate: '2018-05-15'
})

// Document findings
const findings = await verificationInterviews.documentFindings({
  subjectId: 'SUBJ-8421',
  investigationType: 'employment-background',
  summary: 'Subject employment and credentials verified. Positive character references from multiple sources.',
  recommendedAction: 'approve-for-hire'
})

// Flag discrepancy if found
const discrepancy = await verificationInterviews.flagDiscrepancy({
  subjectId: 'SUBJ-8421',
  discrepancyType: 'employment-dates',
  claimed: 'January 2020 - December 2023',
  verified: 'March 2020 - November 2023',
  severity: 'minor',
  explanation: 'dates-rounded-on-resume'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Conduct verification when reference is contacted
verificationInterviews.referenceContacted(async ({ referenceId, subjectId }) => {
  await verificationInterviews.conductVerification({ referenceId, subjectId })
})

// Assess character after verification is complete
verificationInterviews.verificationConducted(async ({ subjectId, referenceId }) => {
  await verificationInterviews.assessCharacter({ subjectId, referenceId })
})

// Document findings after all verifications are complete
verificationInterviews.credentialsVerified(async ({ subjectId }) => {
  const allVerifications = await verificationInterviews.getVerifications({ subjectId })
  if (allVerifications.every(v => v.status === 'complete')) {
    await verificationInterviews.documentFindings({ subjectId })
  }
})

// Alert hiring manager when discrepancy is flagged
verificationInterviews.discrepancyFlagged(async ({ subjectId, discrepancyType, severity }) => {
  if (severity === 'major' || severity === 'critical') {
    await notify({
      to: 'hiring-manager',
      message: `${severity} discrepancy found for candidate ${subjectId}: ${discrepancyType}`,
      urgency: 'high'
    })
  }
})

// Request additional references when unfavorable assessment
verificationInterviews.characterAssessed(async ({ subjectId, overallRating }) => {
  if (overallRating === 'unfavorable' || overallRating === 'concerns-raised') {
    await verificationInterviews.identifyReference({
      subjectId,
      additionalReferences: 2,
      purpose: 'verify-concerns'
    })
  }
})
```
