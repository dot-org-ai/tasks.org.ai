## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { interviewClientsGatherInformationAbout } from '@headlessly/interview-clients-gather-information-about'

const clientInterviews = interviewClientsGatherInformationAbout()

// Conduct intake interview for new client
const intake = await clientInterviews.conductIntakeInterview({
  clientId: 'CLT-6734',
  interviewDate: '2026-02-05T10:00:00Z',
  referralSource: 'Community Health Center',
  presentingConcerns: ['housing-instability', 'unemployment', 'substance-use-history']
})

// Assess client background
const background = await clientInterviews.assessBackground({
  clientId: 'CLT-6734',
  areas: ['education', 'employment-history', 'family-situation', 'health-status', 'legal-history'],
  collateralSources: ['family-member', 'prior-counselor']
})

// Identify specific service needs
const needs = await clientInterviews.identifyNeeds({
  clientId: 'CLT-6734',
  assessmentId: background.id,
  priorityAreas: [
    { need: 'emergency-housing', urgency: 'immediate', duration: '30-days' },
    { need: 'job-training', urgency: 'high', duration: '6-months' },
    { need: 'substance-use-counseling', urgency: 'high', duration: 'ongoing' }
  ]
})

// Develop coordinated service plan
await clientInterviews.developServicePlan({
  clientId: 'CLT-6734',
  needsId: needs.id,
  services: [
    { provider: 'emergency-shelter-program', service: 'temporary-housing', startDate: '2026-02-06' },
    { provider: 'workforce-development-center', service: 'job-readiness-training', startDate: '2026-02-15' },
    { provider: 'outpatient-treatment', service: 'group-counseling', frequency: 'weekly' }
  ],
  goals: ['secure-permanent-housing', 'obtain-employment', 'maintain-sobriety'],
  reviewSchedule: 'monthly'
})

// Review client progress after 30 days
await clientInterviews.reviewProgress({
  clientId: 'CLT-6734',
  reviewDate: '2026-03-05T14:00:00Z',
  achievedMilestones: ['enrolled-in-job-training', 'attending-counseling-regularly'],
  barriers: ['still-in-temporary-housing', 'limited-transportation']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Develop service plan immediately after needs are identified
clientInterviews.needsIdentified(async ({ clientId, needsId }) => {
  await clientInterviews.developServicePlan({ clientId, needsId })
})

// Schedule progress review when service plan is created
clientInterviews.servicePlanDeveloped(async ({ clientId, reviewSchedule }) => {
  await scheduleReview({
    clientId,
    frequency: reviewSchedule,
    firstReview: addDays(new Date(), 30)
  })
})

// Update plan when progress review identifies barriers
clientInterviews.progressReviewed(async ({ clientId, barriers }) => {
  if (barriers.length > 0) {
    await clientInterviews.updatePlan({
      clientId,
      modifications: barriers.map(b => ({ barrier: b, intervention: 'to-be-determined' }))
    })
  }
})

// Alert supervisor when high-urgency needs are identified
clientInterviews.needsIdentified(async ({ clientId, priorityAreas }) => {
  const urgent = priorityAreas.filter(a => a.urgency === 'immediate')
  if (urgent.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'supervising-professional',
      message: `Client ${clientId} has ${urgent.length} immediate needs requiring attention: ${urgent.map(u => u.need).join(', ')}`
    })
  }
})
