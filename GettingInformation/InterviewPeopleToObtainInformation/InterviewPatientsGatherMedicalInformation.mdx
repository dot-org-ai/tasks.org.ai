## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { interviewPatientsGatherMedicalInformation } from '@headlessly/interview-patients-gather-medical-information'

const patientInterviews = interviewPatientsGatherMedicalInformation()

// Initiate patient interview
const interview = await patientInterviews.initiateInterview({
  patientId: 'PT-5829',
  clinicianId: 'DR-3401',
  visitType: 'new-patient',
  interviewDate: '2026-02-05T09:00:00Z'
})

// Elicit chief complaint
const complaint = await patientInterviews.elicitChiefComplaint({
  interviewId: interview.id,
  patientStatement: 'I have been having severe headaches for the past two weeks',
  onset: '2-weeks-ago',
  context: 'started-after-work-stress-increased'
})

// Assess symptoms using OPQRST method
await patientInterviews.assessSymptoms({
  interviewId: interview.id,
  symptom: 'headache',
  assessment: {
    onset: 'gradual over 2 weeks',
    provocation: 'worse with computer work',
    quality: 'throbbing, bilateral frontal',
    radiation: 'none',
    severity: 7,
    timing: 'daily, worse in afternoon'
  }
})

// Review medical history
await patientInterviews.reviewMedicalHistory({
  interviewId: interview.id,
  conditions: [
    { condition: 'hypertension', diagnosedDate: '2020-03-15', status: 'controlled' },
    { condition: 'migraines', diagnosedDate: '2018-06-20', status: 'intermittent' }
  ],

  }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Assess symptoms when chief complaint is documented
patientInterviews.complaintElicited(async ({ interviewId, complaint }) => {
  await patientInterviews.assessSymptoms({
    interviewId,
    symptom: complaint.primarySymptom
  })
})

// Reconcile medications after history is reviewed
patientInterviews.historyReviewed(async ({ interviewId }) => {
  await patientInterviews.reconcileMedications({ interviewId })
})

// Document interview when all sections are complete
patientInterviews.systemsReviewed(async ({ interviewId }) => {
  await patientInterviews.documentInterview({ interviewId })
})

// Alert for critical symptoms during assessment
patientInterviews.symptomsAssessed(async ({ interviewId, patientId, assessment }) => {
  const criticalSymptoms = ['chest-pain', 'severe-headache-sudden-onset', 'difficulty-breathing']
  if (criticalSymptoms.some(s => assessment.includes(s))) {
    await notify({
      to: 'supervising-physician',
      message: `Patient ${patientId} presents with critical symptoms requiring immediate evaluation`,
      urgency: 'high'
