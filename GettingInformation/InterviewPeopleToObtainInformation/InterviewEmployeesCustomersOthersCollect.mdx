## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { interviewEmployeesCustomersOthersCollect } from '@headlessly/interview-employees-customers-others-collect'

const stakeholderInterviews = interviewEmployeesCustomersOthersCollect()

// Design interview protocol for employee engagement study
const protocol = await stakeholderInterviews.designProtocol({
  purpose: 'employee-engagement-assessment',
  stakeholderType: 'employee',
  topics: ['work-environment', 'management-communication', 'career-development', 'compensation-benefits'],
  questionTypes: ['open-ended', 'rating-scale'],
  duration: 30
})

// Schedule interviews with employees
const employeeInterview = await stakeholderInterviews.scheduleInterview({
  protocolId: protocol.id,
  stakeholderId: 'EMP-4523',
  stakeholderType: 'employee',
  scheduledDate: '2026-02-10T15:00:00Z',
  method: 'video-conference'
})

const customerInterview = await stakeholderInterviews.scheduleInterview({
  protocolId: protocol.id,
  stakeholderId: 'CUST-8921',
  stakeholderType: 'customer',
  scheduledDate: '2026-02-11T10:00:00Z',
  method: 'phone'
})

// Conduct interview and record responses
await stakeholderInterviews.conductInterview({
  interviewId: employeeInterview.id,
  recordingMethod: 'notes',
  consentObtained: true
})

await stakeholderInterviews.recordResponses({
  interviewId: employeeInterview.id,
  responses: [
    { question: 'How would you rate communication from management?', answer: '6/10', notes: 'Would like more frequent updates' },
    { question: 'What would improve your work environment?', answer: 'More flexible work-from-home options' }
  ]
})

// Analyze themes after completing multiple interviews
const themes = await stakeholderInterviews.analyzeThemes({
  protocolId: protocol.id,
  minFrequency: 3
})

// Identify improvement opportunities
await stakeholderInterviews.identifyOpportunities({
  themeIds: themes.map(t => t.id),
  prioritizationCriteria: ['frequency', 'impact', 'feasibility']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Record responses immediately after interview is conducted
stakeholderInterviews.interviewConducted(async ({ interviewId }) => {
  await stakeholderInterviews.recordResponses({ interviewId })
})

// Trigger analysis when target interview count is reached
stakeholderInterviews.responsesRecorded(async ({ protocolId }) => {
  const completed = await stakeholderInterviews.findInterviews({
    protocolId,
    status: 'completed'
  })

  if (completed.length >= 20) {
    await stakeholderInterviews.analyzeThemes({ protocolId })
  }
})

// Generate report when opportunities are identified
stakeholderInterviews.opportunitiesIdentified(async ({ protocolId }) => {
  await stakeholderInterviews.generateReport({ protocolId })
})

// Alert leadership when high-priority opportunities are found
stakeholderInterviews.opportunitiesIdentified(async ({ opportunities }) => {
  const urgent = opportunities.filter(o => o.priority === 'high' && o.impact === 'significant')
  if (urgent.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'executive-team',
      message: `Interview findings reveal ${urgent.length} high-priority improvement opportunities: ${urgent.map(o => o.title).join(', ')}`
    })
  }
})
