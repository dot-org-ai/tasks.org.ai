## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { interviewPeopleGatherInformationAbout } from '@headlessly/interview-people-gather-information-about'

const criminalInterviews = interviewPeopleGatherInformationAbout()

// Identify witness with relevant information
const interviewee = await criminalInterviews.identifyInterviewee({
  investigationId: 'INV-2026-3421',
  personType: 'witness',
  relevance: 'observed-suspect-fleeing-scene',
  contactMethod: 'community-canvass'
})

// Conduct investigative interview
const interview = await criminalInterviews.conductInterview({
  investigationId: 'INV-2026-3421',
  intervieweeId: interviewee.id,
  location: 'police-station',
  method: 'recorded-video',
  mirandaRequired: false,
  advisementGiven: true
})

// Record witness statement
const statement = await criminalInterviews.recordStatement({
  interviewId: interview.id,
  narrative: 'Witness observed male subject approximately 6 feet tall running from alley at 2:30 AM carrying dark bag',
  keyDetails: [
    'suspect-description: tall, dark-clothing, approximately-30-years-old',
    'direction-of-travel: north-on-main-street',
    'time: 2:30-AM-approximately',
    'carried: dark-colored-backpack'
  ]
})

// Corroborate with other evidence
await criminalInterviews.corroborateEvidence({
  statementId: statement.id,
  evidenceSources: [
    { type: 'surveillance-video', location: 'main-street-camera-3', timestamp: '02:31:15' },
    { type: 'physical-evidence', item: 'backpack-recovered', location: 'dumpster-400-block-main' }
  ]
})

// Assess credibility of witness account
const credibility = await criminalInterviews.assessCredibility({
  statementId: statement.id,
  factors: {
    consistency: 'high',
    specificity: 'detailed',
    demeanor: 'cooperative',
    corroboration: 'strong'
  }
})

// Protect witness identity if needed
if (credibility.reliable) {
  await criminalInterviews.protectIdentity({
    intervieweeId: interviewee.id,
    protectionLevel: 'confidential-witness',
    measures: ['redact-from-public-reports', 'assign-identifier-code']
  })
}

// Preserve chain of custody
await criminalInterviews.preserveChain({
  statementId: statement.id,
  custodyLog: [
    { officer: 'detective-martinez', action: 'recorded-statement', timestamp: '2026-02-05T03:15:00Z' },
    { officer: 'evidence-officer-chen', action: 'transferred-to-evidence', timestamp: '2026-02-05T04:00:00Z' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Record statement immediately after interview
criminalInterviews.interviewConducted(async ({ interviewId }) => {
  await criminalInterviews.recordStatement({ interviewId })
})

// Corroborate evidence when statement is recorded
criminalInterviews.statementRecorded(async ({ statementId, investigationId }) => {
  await criminalInterviews.corroborateEvidence({
    statementId,
    investigationId
  })
})

// Assess credibility after corroboration
criminalInterviews.evidenceCorroborated(async ({ statementId }) => {
  await criminalInterviews.assessCredibility({ statementId })
})

// Alert supervisor when high-value intelligence is obtained
criminalInterviews.credibilityAssessed(async ({ statementId, investigationId, credibility }) => {
  if (credibility.level === 'high' && credibility.intelligence === 'critical') {
    await notify({
      to: 'investigation-supervisor',
      message: `High-credibility critical intelligence obtained in case ${investigationId} - statement ${statementId}`,
      urgency: 'immediate'
    })
  }
})

// Protect identity for informants automatically
criminalInterviews.interviewConducted(async ({ intervieweeType, intervieweeId }) => {
  if (intervieweeType === 'informant') {
    await criminalInterviews.protectIdentity({
      intervieweeId,
      protectionLevel: 'confidential-informant',
      measures: ['assign-ci-number', 'redact-all-identifying-information']
    })
  }
})
