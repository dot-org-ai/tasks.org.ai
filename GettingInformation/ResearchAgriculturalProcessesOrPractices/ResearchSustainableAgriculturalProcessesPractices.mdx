# Research Sustainable Agricultural Processes Practices

> Business-as-Code definition for sustainable agriculture research. Models investigation of regenerative farming methods, conservation practices, and environmentally responsible production systems that maintain productivity while preserving natural resources.

## Overview

Sustainable agriculture research focuses on developing farming practices that minimize environmental impact, conserve soil and water resources, reduce chemical inputs, and maintain long-term productivity. This definition provides actions for evaluating conservation techniques, measuring environmental outcomes, and validating regenerative agriculture systems across diverse production contexts.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { researchSustainableAgriculturalProcessesPractices } from '@headlessly/research-sustainable-agricultural-processes-practices'

const research = researchSustainableAgriculturalProcessesPractices()

// Launch a cover crop carbon sequestration study
const project = await research.initiateSustainabilityResearch({
  title: 'Carbon Sequestration in Multi-Species Cover Crops',
  practiceType: 'cover_cropping',
  goal: 'Measure soil carbon increase and erosion reduction',
  sites: 12,
  duration: '3 years'
})

// Apply conservation practice at research sites
await research.implementConservation({
  projectId: project.id,
  practice: 'multi_species_cover_crop',
  species: ['rye', 'clover', 'radish'],
  plantingDate: '2025-10-01'
})

// Evaluate overall sustainability outcomes
const assessment = await research.evaluateViability({
  projectId: project.id,
  metrics: ['soil_carbon', 'erosion_rate', 'profit_margin', 'labor_hours']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert when significant carbon sequestration is detected
research.carbonImpactCalculated(async ({ projectId, practice, sequestration }) => {
  if (sequestration > 1.5) {
    await notify({
      to: 'sustainability-team',
      message: `${practice} sequestering ${sequestration} tons CO2/acre/year`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-certify practices that meet sustainability thresholds
research.viabilityEvaluated(async ({ projectId, practice, outcomes }) => {
  if (outcomes.soilHealth > 85 && outcomes.profitMargin > 0) {
    await research.certifyPractice({
      projectId,
      practice,
      certification: 'regenerative_verified'
    })
  }
})
```
