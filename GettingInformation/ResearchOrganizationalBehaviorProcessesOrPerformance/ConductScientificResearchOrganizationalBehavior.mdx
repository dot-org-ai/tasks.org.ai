# Conduct Scientific Research of Organizational Behavior

> Business-as-Code definition for conducting scientific research of organizational behavior or processes. Models the workflow from literature review through hypothesis development, study design, data collection, statistical analysis, and findings dissemination.

## Overview

Conducting scientific research of organizational behavior or processes involves applying rigorous research methods to study how individuals, teams, and systems function within organizations. Researchers review existing literature, develop testable hypotheses, design experiments or observational studies, collect behavioral and process data, apply statistical analyses, and publish findings that advance management theory and inform organizational practice. This definition exposes actions for behavioral research, events for study milestones, and searches for retrieving research data and publications.

| dataAnalyzed | Statistical tests and models have been applied to the data |
| findingsInterpreted | Conclusions about organizational behavior have been drawn |
| resultsDisseminated | Findings have been published and shared with practitioners |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| findStudies | Search research projects by topic, organization, or investigator |
| getLiteratureReviews | Retrieve systematic reviews by subject area or date |
| getDatasets | Locate behavioral datasets by construct, sample, or study |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { conductScientificResearchOrganizationalBehavior } from '@headlessly/conduct-scientific-research-organizational-behavior'

const research = conductScientificResearchOrganizationalBehavior()

// Review literature and develop hypothesis
const review = await research.reviewLiterature({
  topic: 'psychological-safety-innovation',
  databases: ['psychInfo', 'webOfScience', 'scopus'],
  yearRange: { from: 2015, to: 2026 }
})

const hypothesis = await research.developHypothesis({
  reviewId: review.id,
  prediction: 'Teams with higher psychological safety report greater innovative behavior, mediated by knowledge sharing',
  constructs: ['psychologicalSafety', 'knowledgeSharing', 'innovativeBehavior']
})

// Design and execute the study
const study = await research.designStudy({
  hypothesisId: hypothesis.id,
  method: 'crossSectionalSurvey',
  sample: { targetSize: 300, unit: 'teams', selection: 'stratifiedRandom' },
  measures: ['edmondsonPsychSafetyScale', 'knowledgeSharingIndex', 'innovativeBehaviorScale']
})

await research.collectBehavioralData({
  studyId: study.id,
  organization: 'tech-company-partner',
  duration: '6-weeks'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify statistician when data collection is complete
research.behavioralDataCollected(async ({ studyId, sampleSize }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'statistician',
    message: `Data collection complete for study ${studyId}: ${sampleSize} participants`
  })
})

// Auto-interpret when analysis is done
research.dataAnalyzed(async ({ studyId, significantPaths }) => {
  await research.interpretFindings({ studyId })
})
```
