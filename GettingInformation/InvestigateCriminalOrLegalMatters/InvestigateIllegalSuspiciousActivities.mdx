## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { investigateIllegalSuspiciousActivities } from '@headlessly/investigate-illegal-suspicious-activities'

const investigations = investigateIllegalSuspiciousActivities()

// Receive a tip about suspicious activity
const tip = await investigations.receiveTip({
  source: 'confidential-informant',
  activityType: 'narcotics-distribution',
  location: 'warehouse-district',
  description: 'Frequent late-night deliveries to abandoned warehouse'
})

// Open an investigation case
const case_ = await investigations.openCase({
  tipId: tip.id,
  category: 'narcotics',
  assignedTeam: ['detective-garcia', 'analyst-nguyen'],
  priority: 'high'
})

// Conduct surveillance and analyze intelligence
await investigations.conductSurveillance({
  caseId: case_.id,
  subject: 'warehouse-target',
  methods: ['physical', 'vehicleTracking'],
  duration: '14d'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert the prosecutor when evidence is compiled
investigations.evidenceCompiled(async ({ caseId, evidenceCount }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'prosecutor',
    message: `Case ${caseId} evidence package ready: ${evidenceCount} items`
  })
})

// Notify team when intelligence analysis is complete
investigations.intelligenceAnalyzed(async ({ caseId, findings }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'investigation-team',
    message: `Intelligence analysis complete for case ${caseId}: ${findings.summary}`
  })
})
```
