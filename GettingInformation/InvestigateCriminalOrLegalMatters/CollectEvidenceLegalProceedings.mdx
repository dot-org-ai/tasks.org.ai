# Collect Evidence for Legal Proceedings

> Business-as-Code definition for collecting evidence for legal proceedings. Models the workflow from evidence identification through acquisition, chain-of-custody management, and courtroom preparation.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { collectEvidenceLegalProceedings } from '@headlessly/collect-evidence-legal-proceedings'

const evidence = collectEvidenceLegalProceedings()

// Identify relevant evidence for a contract dispute
const items = await evidence.identifyEvidence({
  caseId: 'civil-2026-0442',
  categories: ['contracts', 'correspondence', 'financialRecords'],
  dateRange: { from: '2024-01-01', to: '2026-06-30' }
})

// Acquire a specific documentary exhibit
const exhibit = await evidence.acquireEvidence({
  caseId: 'civil-2026-0442',
  source: 'opposing-party',
  description: 'Original signed contract dated 2024-03-15',
  method: 'subpoena'
})

// Record chain of custody
await evidence.recordChainOfCustody({
  evidenceId: exhibit.id,
  action: 'received',
  handler: 'paralegal-jones',
  location: 'firm-evidence-room',
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify the litigation attorney when evidence is acquired
evidence.evidenceAcquired(async ({ caseId, evidenceId, description }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'litigation-attorney',
    message: `Evidence acquired for case ${caseId}: ${description}`
  })
})

// Auto-catalog exhibits after forensic reports are received
evidence.evidenceSubmittedToLab(async ({ evidenceId, caseId }) => {
  await evidence.catalogExhibits({ caseId, evidenceIds: [evidenceId] })
})
```
