# Research Relevant Legal Materials to Aid Decision Making

> Business-as-Code definition for researching relevant legal materials to aid decision making. Models the workflow from issue framing through source identification, legal research, synthesis, and recommendation delivery.

Researching relevant legal materials to aid decision making involves framing the legal question, identifying authoritative sources, conducting systematic research across statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative guidance, synthesizing findings, and presenting actionable recommendations to decision makers. This applies in corporate governance, regulatory compliance, contract negotiations, and policy development. This definition exposes actions for legal research, events for research milestones, and searches for retrieving legal materials and analyses.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { researchRelevantLegalMaterialsAid } from '@headlessly/research-relevant-legal-materials-aid'

const research = researchRelevantLegalMaterialsAid()

// Frame the legal question for a corporate acquisition decision
const question = await research.frameLegalQuestion({
  matterId: 'acquisition-review-2026',
  question: 'What antitrust approvals are required for a horizontal merger in the semiconductor industry?',
  jurisdiction: 'federal',
  urgency: 'high'
})

// Identify sources and conduct research
await research.identifyAuthoritativeSources({
  questionId: question.id,
  sources: ['shermanAct', 'claytonAct', 'ftcGuidelines', 'dojMergerReview']
})

const caseLaw = await research.searchCaseLaw({
  questionId: question.id,
  keywords: ['horizontal merger', 'semiconductor', 'market concentration'],
  jurisdictions: ['federal-circuit', 'supreme-court'],
  dateRange: { from: '2015-01-01', to: '2026-02-01' }
})

// Synthesize and deliver
await research.synthesizeFindings({
  questionId: question.id,
  sources: ['statutes', 'caseLaw', 'regulatoryGuidance']
})

await research.draftResearchMemorandum({
  questionId: question.id,
  sections: ['issueStatement', 'applicableLaw', 'analysis', 'recommendation']
