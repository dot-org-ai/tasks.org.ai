## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { identifyEnvironmentalConcerns } from '@headlessly/identify-environmental-concerns'

const concerns = identifyEnvironmentalConcerns()

// Conduct environmental review of facility
const review = await concerns.conductReview({
  facility: 'Manufacturing Plant - Building 5',
  scope: ['waste management', 'air emissions', 'water discharge', 'chemical storage'],
  methodology: 'ISO 14001 compliance audit',
  date: '2026-02-10'
})

// Engage stakeholders for input
await concerns.engageStakeholders({
  reviewId: review.id,
  stakeholders: [
    { type: 'community', group: 'Riverside Neighborhood Association', method: 'public meeting' },
    { type: 'regulatory', agency: 'State Environmental Quality Department', method: 'consultation' },
    { type: 'employee', group: 'Environmental Health & Safety Committee', method: 'survey' }
  ]
})

// Document identified concerns
await concerns.documentConcerns({
  reviewId: review.id,
  concerns: [
    {
      type: 'air emissions',
      description: 'VOC emissions from coating operation exceed permit limits during peak production',
      source: 'emissions monitoring data',
      regulatory: 'Clean Air Act Title V permit'
    },
    {
      type: 'waste management',
      description: 'Hazardous waste accumulation exceeds 90-day limit',
      source: 'internal audit',
      regulatory: 'RCRA generator requirements'
    },
    {
      type: 'community impact',
      description: 'Noise complaints from night shift operations',
      source: 'community feedback',
      regulatory: 'local noise ordinance'
    }
  ]
})

// Prioritize risks
await concerns.prioritizeRisks({
  reviewId: review.id,
  criteria: {
    regulatoryImpact: 'weight: 40%',
    communityImpact: 'weight: 30%',
    financialRisk: 'weight: 20%',
    reputationalRisk: 'weight: 10%'
  }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert management when high-priority concerns identified
concerns.risksPrioritized(async ({ reviewId, concerns }) => {
  const critical = concerns.filter(c => c.priority === 'critical' || c.priority === 'high')
  if (critical.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'environmental-manager@company.com',
      subject: 'Critical Environmental Concerns Identified',
      message: `Review ${reviewId} found ${critical.length} high-priority environmental issues`,
      priority: 'urgent'
    })
  }
})

// Create action plan tasks when ownership assigned
concerns.ownershipAssigned(async ({ concernId, owner, priority }) => {
  await createTask({
    title: `Address environmental concern ${concernId}`,
    assignee: owner,
    priority: priority,
    dueDate: calculateDueDate(priority),
    type: 'environmental-action'
  })
})
