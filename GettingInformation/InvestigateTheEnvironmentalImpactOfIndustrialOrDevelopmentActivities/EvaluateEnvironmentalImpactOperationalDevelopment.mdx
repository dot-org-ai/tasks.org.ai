# Evaluate Environmental Impact Operational Development

> Business-as-Code definition for evaluating environmental impact of operational and development activities. Models comprehensive assessment of ecological effects from industrial operations, construction projects, and resource extraction activities.

## Overview

Evaluating environmental impact involves analyzing ecological effects of business operations, construction, and development projects on air quality, water resources, soil conditions, wildlife habitats, and communities. This definition supports environmental impact assessments, regulatory compliance, sustainability planning, and mitigation strategy development using established methodologies and scientific data.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { evaluateEnvironmentalImpactOperationalDevelopment } from '@headlessly/evaluate-environmental-impact-operational-development'

const evaluation = evaluateEnvironmentalImpactOperationalDevelopment()

// Define assessment scope for new facility
const scope = await evaluation.defineScope({
  project: 'New Manufacturing Facility',
  location: '1500 Industrial Drive, Denver CO',
  activities: ['construction', 'wastewater discharge', 'air emissions', 'stormwater runoff'],
  categories: ['air quality', 'water resources', 'soil contamination', 'noise levels']
})

// Conduct baseline environmental study
await evaluation.conductBaseline({
  scopeId: scope.id,
  parameters: [
    { category: 'air quality', measurements: ['PM2.5', 'NOx', 'VOC'], duration: '12 months' },
    { category: 'water resources', measurements: ['pH', 'dissolved oxygen', 'turbidity'], sites: 3 }
  ],
  samplingPlan: 'baseline-monitoring-2026.pdf'
})

// Model environmental impacts
const impacts = await evaluation.modelImpacts({
  scopeId: scope.id,
  models: [
    { type: 'air dispersion', software: 'AERMOD', emissions: 'facility-emissions-inventory.csv' },
    { type: 'noise propagation', method: 'ISO 9613', sources: 'equipment-noise-levels.xlsx' }
  ]
})

// Assess significance and develop mitigation
await evaluation.assessSignificance({
  scopeId: scope.id,
  criteria: 'EPA significance thresholds',
  findings: impacts.results
})

await evaluation.developMitigation({
  scopeId: scope.id,
  measures: [
    { impact: 'NOx emissions', action: 'Install SCR system', reduction: '85%' },
    { impact: 'stormwater runoff', action: 'Construct retention pond', capacity: '100,000 gallons' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert when significant impacts identified
evaluation.significanceAssessed(async ({ scopeId, impacts }) => {
  const significant = impacts.filter(i => i.significance === 'major')
  if (significant.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'environmental-team@company.com',
      subject: 'Significant Environmental Impacts Identified',
      message: `Assessment ${scopeId} found ${significant.length} major impacts requiring mitigation`,
      priority: 'high'
    })
  }
})

// Create compliance tasks when report prepared
evaluation.reportPrepared(async ({ scopeId, requiredPermits }) => {
  for (const permit of requiredPermits) {
    await createTask({
      title: `Apply for ${permit.type}`,
      assignee: 'compliance-specialist',
      dueDate: permit.deadline,
      description: `Required for project approval`
    })
  }
})
```
