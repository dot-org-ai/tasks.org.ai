# Research Issues Related to the Environment or Sustainable Business Practices

> Business-as-Code definition for researching issues related to the environment or sustainable business practices. Models the workflow from issue scoping through literature review, data gathering, sustainability analysis, and policy recommendation.

## Overview

Researching issues related to the environment or sustainable business practices involves investigating topics such as carbon emissions, resource depletion, circular economy models, supply chain sustainability, environmental regulations, and corporate social responsibility to inform strategic decisions and compliance efforts. Researchers scope the issue, review regulatory and scientific literature, gather operational and environmental data, analyze sustainability performance, and develop recommendations for organizational policy. This definition exposes actions for sustainability research, events for investigation milestones, and searches for retrieving environmental and sustainability data.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { researchIssuesRelatedEnvironmentSustainable } from '@headlessly/research-issues-related-environment-sustainable'

const sustainability = researchIssuesRelatedEnvironmentSustainable()

// Scope the issue and review regulations
const issue = await sustainability.scopeIssue({
  topic: 'scope3SupplyChainEmissions',
  sector: 'consumerElectronics',
  urgency: 'high',
  drivers: ['euCsrd', 'investorPressure', 'customerDemand']
})

await sustainability.reviewRegulatoryLandscape({
  issueId: issue.id,
  jurisdictions: ['eu', 'us-california', 'uk'],
  frameworks: ['ghgProtocol', 'tcfd', 'sbti']
})

// Gather data and analyze
await sustainability.gatherEnvironmentalData({
  issueId: issue.id,
  sources: ['supplierSurveys', 'lifeCycleAssessments', 'emissionFactorDatabases'],
  metrics: ['scope3Emissions', 'materialIntensity', 'renewableEnergyShare']
})

await sustainability.analyzeSustainabilityPerformance({
  issueId: issue.id,
  benchmarks: ['industryAverage', 'sbtiTargets', 'peerGroup']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify ESG analyst when performance analysis is complete
sustainability.sustainabilityPerformanceAnalyzed(async ({ issueId, gapToTarget }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'esg-analyst',
    message: `Sustainability analysis complete for issue ${issueId}: gap to target is ${gapToTarget}%`
  })
})

// Auto-develop policy when risks are assessed
sustainability.risksAndOpportunitiesAssessed(async ({ issueId }) => {
  await sustainability.developPolicyRecommendation({ issueId })
})
```
