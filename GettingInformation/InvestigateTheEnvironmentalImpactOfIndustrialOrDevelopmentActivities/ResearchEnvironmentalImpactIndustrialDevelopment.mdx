# Research Environmental Impact Industrial Development

> Business-as-Code definition for researching environmental impacts of industrial and development activities. Models scientific investigation, data collection, literature review, and impact analysis to inform environmental assessments, policy decisions, and sustainable development practices.

## Overview

Researching environmental impacts of industrial and development activities involves conducting scientific studies, reviewing academic literature, collecting field data, analyzing ecological effects, and publishing findings. Environmental scientists and researchers examine how manufacturing, construction, energy production, mining, and land development affect air quality, water resources, soil health, biodiversity, and climate. This definition supports environmental impact assessments, policy development, regulatory decisions, and corporate sustainability initiatives.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { researchEnvironmentalImpactIndustrialDevelopment } from '@headlessly/research-environmental-impact-industrial-development'

const research = researchEnvironmentalImpactIndustrialDevelopment()

// Initiate a research project on mining impacts
const project = await research.initiateResearch({
  title: 'Water Quality Impacts of Open-Pit Mining in the Sierra Nevada',
  researchQuestions: [
    'What is the extent of heavy metal contamination in downstream watersheds?',
    'How does pH vary with distance from mining operations?',
    'What are the effects on aquatic invertebrate communities?'
  ],
  fundingSource: 'National Science Foundation',
  principalInvestigator: 'Dr. Patricia Chen',
  duration: '3-years'
})

// Conduct literature review
await research.conductLiteratureReview({
  projectId: project.id,
  topics: ['mine-drainage', 'heavy-metal-toxicity', 'aquatic-ecology'],
  databases: ['Web of Science', 'Google Scholar', 'Environmental Science Database'],
  yearsReviewed: 20
})

// Design field study and collect samples
await research.designFieldStudy({
  projectId: project.id,
  samplingLocations: ['upstream-control', 'adjacent-to-mine', 'downstream-5km', 'downstream-20km'],
  parameters: ['pH', 'dissolved-oxygen', 'copper', 'lead', 'zinc', 'macroinvertebrates'],
  frequency: 'quarterly',
  duration: '2-years'
})

await research.collectEnvironmentalSamples({
  projectId: project.id,
  sampleDate: '2026-03-15',
  location: 'downstream-5km',
  samples: [
    { type: 'water', parameter: 'heavy-metals', method: 'ICP-MS' },
    { type: 'sediment', parameter: 'metal-accumulation', method: 'acid-digestion' },
    { type: 'biological', parameter: 'invertebrate-survey', method: 'kick-net' }
  ]
})

// Analyze data and publish findings
await research.analyzeImpactData({
  projectId: project.id,
  methods: ['ANOVA', 'regression-analysis', 'biodiversity-indices'],
  findings: 'Copper levels exceeded aquatic life criteria at downstream sites'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert regulators when significant impacts are found
research.impactDataAnalyzed(async ({ projectId, findings }) => {
  if (findings.includes('exceeded') || findings.includes('significant')) {
    await notify({
      to: 'regional-water-quality-board',
      message: `Research project ${projectId} found significant environmental impacts requiring regulatory attention`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-submit findings for publication when modeling is complete
research.environmentalEffectsModeled(async ({ projectId }) => {
  await research.publishFindings({
    projectId,
    venues: ['Environmental Science & Technology', 'Water Resources Research']
  })
})
```
