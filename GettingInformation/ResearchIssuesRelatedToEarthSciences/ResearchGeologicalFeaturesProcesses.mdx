# Research Geological Features or Processes

> Business-as-Code definition for researching geological features or processes. Models the workflow from hypothesis formulation through field mapping, sample collection, laboratory analysis, geologic modeling, and publication.

## Overview

Researching geological features or processes involves studying the composition, structure, and dynamics of the Earth's crust, including rock formations, mineral deposits, fault systems, volcanic activity, and sedimentary processes. Geoscientists formulate research questions, conduct field mapping, collect rock and mineral samples, perform laboratory analyses, build geologic models, and publish findings that inform resource exploration, hazard assessment, and land use planning. This definition exposes actions for geological research, events for investigation milestones, and searches for retrieving geologic data and publications.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { researchGeologicalFeaturesProcesses } from '@headlessly/research-geological-features-processes'

const geology = researchGeologicalFeaturesProcesses()

// Formulate a research hypothesis
const study = await geology.formulateHypothesis({
  title: 'Structural Controls on Gold Mineralization in the Greenstone Belt',
  hypothesis: 'Gold deposits are concentrated along second-order shear zones adjacent to the regional fault',
  studyArea: { region: 'abitibi-greenstone-belt', coordinates: { lat: 48.45, lon: -79.12 } },
  methods: ['fieldMapping', 'petrography', 'wholeRockGeochemistry', 'fluidInclusionStudy']
})

// Conduct field work and collect samples
await geology.conductFieldMapping({
  studyId: study.id,
  scale: '1:10000',
  features: ['lithologicContacts', 'faultTraces', 'foldAxes', 'mineralization']
})

await geology.collectSamples({
  studyId: study.id,
  sampleTypes: ['channelSamples', 'drillCore', 'surfaceGrab'],
  count: 45
})

// Analyze and model
await geology.performLaboratoryAnalysis({
  studyId: study.id,
  methods: ['thinSection', 'xrfGeochemistry', 'argentometricAssay']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify team when laboratory results are available
geology.laboratoryAnalysisPerformed(async ({ studyId, sampleCount }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'research-team',
    message: `Lab analysis complete for ${sampleCount} samples in study ${studyId}`
  })
})

// Auto-build model when all analyses are done
geology.laboratoryAnalysisPerformed(async ({ studyId }) => {
  await geology.buildGeologicModel({ studyId })
})
```
