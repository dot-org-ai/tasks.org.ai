# Conduct Climatological Research

> Business-as-Code definition for conducting climatological research. Models the workflow from research design through data acquisition, statistical analysis, climate modeling, and dissemination of findings.

## Overview

Conducting climatological research involves studying long-term weather patterns, atmospheric processes, and climate variability to understand trends such as temperature change, precipitation shifts, and extreme weather frequency. Researchers design observational and modeling studies, acquire historical and real-time climate data, perform statistical analyses, run climate simulations, and publish findings that inform adaptation planning, agriculture, infrastructure design, and policy. This definition exposes actions for climate research, events for study milestones, and searches for retrieving climate data and publications.

## Actors

| Actor | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| NationalWeatherService | Maintains historical weather observation networks and datasets |
| ClimateDataCenter | Archives long-term climate records and reanalysis products |
| SatelliteAgency | Provides remote sensing data on atmospheric composition and temperature |
| AgriculturalResearchService | Uses climate data for crop yield modeling and growing season analysis |
| InfrastructurePlanningAgency | Applies climate projections to design standards and resilience planning |
| InternationalClimatePanel | Coordinates global climate assessments and scenario development |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { conductClimatologicalResearch } from '@headlessly/conduct-climatological-research'

const climate = conductClimatologicalResearch()

// Design a research study on extreme precipitation trends
const study = await climate.designResearchStudy({
  title: 'Extreme Precipitation Frequency Analysis for the Great Lakes Region',
  objectives: ['updateIDFCurves', 'assessNonstationarity', 'projectFutureExtremes'],
  region: 'great-lakes-basin',
  variables: ['dailyPrecipitation', 'annualMaxima'],
  period: { historical: '1950-2025', projection: '2026-2100' }
})

// Acquire data and perform analysis
await climate.acquireClimateData({
  studyId: study.id,
  sources: ['ghcn-daily', 'era5-reanalysis', 'cmip6-projections'],
  variables: ['precipitation', 'temperature']
})

await climate.performStatisticalAnalysis({
  studyId: study.id,
  methods: ['generalizedExtremeValue', 'mannKendallTrend', 'changePointDetection']
})

// Run climate model simulations
await climate.configureClimateModel({
  studyId: study.id,
  model: 'wrf-regional',
  scenarios: ['ssp245', 'ssp585'],
  resolution: '4km'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify stakeholders when projections are validated
climate.resultsValidated(async ({ studyId, biasScore }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'infrastructure-planning',
    message: `Climate projections validated for study ${studyId} with bias score ${biasScore.toFixed(2)}`
  })
})

// Auto-disseminate when validation passes
climate.resultsValidated(async ({ studyId, acceptable }) => {
  if (acceptable) {
    await climate.disseminateFindings({ studyId })
  }
})
```
