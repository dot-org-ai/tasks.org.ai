# Research Hydrologic Features or Processes

> Business-as-Code definition for researching hydrologic features or processes. Models the workflow from study design through data collection, hydrologic modeling, analysis, and findings publication.

## Overview

Researching hydrologic features or processes involves studying the movement, distribution, and quality of water across landscapes including rivers, aquifers, watersheds, wetlands, and groundwater systems. Scientists design field studies, collect streamflow and precipitation data, analyze water chemistry, build hydrologic models, and publish findings that inform water resource management, flood prediction, and environmental policy. This definition exposes actions for hydrologic research, events for study milestones, and searches for retrieving hydrologic data and publications.

## Actors

| Actor | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| WaterResourcesAgency | Funds and directs hydrologic research for water management purposes |
| GeologicalSurvey | Maintains long-term streamflow gauges and groundwater monitoring networks |
| EnvironmentalProtectionAgency | Sets water quality standards and requires compliance monitoring |
| UniversityResearchLab | Conducts fundamental and applied hydrologic research |
| FloodManagementAuthority | Uses hydrologic data for flood forecasting and mitigation planning |
| WeatherForecastingService | Provides precipitation and climate data for hydrologic analysis |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { researchHydrologicFeaturesProcesses } from '@headlessly/research-hydrologic-features-processes'

const hydro = researchHydrologicFeaturesProcesses()

// Design a watershed study
const study = await hydro.designStudy({
  title: 'Baseflow Recession Analysis of the Upper Cedar Creek Watershed',
  objectives: ['characterizeBaseflow', 'estimateAquiferContribution', 'modelDroughtResponse'],
  studyArea: { watershed: 'upper-cedar-creek', huc12: '071000040301' },
  duration: '24-months'
})

// Install instrumentation and collect data
await hydro.installInstrumentation({
  studyId: study.id,
  instruments: [
    { type: 'streamGauge', location: 'cedar-creek-outlet', parameters: ['stage', 'discharge'] },
    { type: 'monitoringWell', location: 'alluvial-aquifer-MW1', parameters: ['waterLevel', 'temperature'] },
    { type: 'rainGauge', location: 'watershed-centroid', parameters: ['precipitation'] }
  ]
})

await hydro.collectHydrologicData({
  studyId: study.id,
  period: { from: '2026-03-01', to: '2027-02-28' },
  frequency: 'daily'
})

// Build and calibrate model
await hydro.buildHydrologicModel({
  studyId: study.id,
  modelType: 'rainfallRunoff',
  software: 'hec-hms',
  inputs: ['precipitation', 'evapotranspiration', 'soilProperties']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify research team when model is calibrated
hydro.modelCalibrated(async ({ studyId, nashSutcliffe }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'research-team',
    message: `Model calibrated for study ${studyId} with NSE=${nashSutcliffe.toFixed(2)}`
  })
})

// Auto-analyze results when calibration is acceptable
hydro.modelCalibrated(async ({ studyId, nashSutcliffe }) => {
  if (nashSutcliffe > 0.7) {
    await hydro.analyzeResults({ studyId })
  }
})
```
