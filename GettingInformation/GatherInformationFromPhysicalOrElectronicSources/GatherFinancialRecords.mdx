### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { gatherFinancialRecords } from '@headlessly/gather-financial-records'

const records = gatherFinancialRecords()

// Initiate a request for audit-related records
const request = await records.initiateRequest({
  engagementId: 'audit-2026-q1',
  entity: 'acme-corp',
  documentTypes: ['bankStatements', 'generalLedger', 'taxReturns', 'payrollRecords'],
  period: { from: '2025-01-01', to: '2025-12-31' }
})

// Retrieve documents from identified sources
const docs = await records.retrieveDocuments({
  requestId: request.id,
  sources: ['first-national-bank', 'adp-payroll', 'irs-transcripts']
})

// Verify completeness and assemble
await records.verifyCompleteness({
  requestId: request.id,
  expectedDocuments: request.documentTypes,
  receivedCount: docs.length
})

await records.assemblePackage({
  requestId: request.id,
  recipient: 'external-auditor'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert coordinator when documents are retrieved
records.documentsRetrieved(async ({ requestId, source, documentCount }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'audit-coordinator',
    message: `${documentCount} documents received from ${source} for request ${requestId}`
  })
})

// Auto-assemble package when all records are verified
records.completenessVerified(async ({ requestId, complete }) => {
  if (complete) {
    await records.indexRecords({ requestId })
    await records.assemblePackage({ requestId })
  }
})
```
