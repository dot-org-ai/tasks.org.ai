const property = obtainPropertyInformation()

// Identify the subject property
const parcel = await property.identifyProperty({
  address: '1425 Elm Street',
  city: 'Springfield',
  state: 'IL',
  parcelNumber: '14-23-301-009'
})

// Retrieve the deed and examine title
const deed = await property.retrieveDeed({
  parcelId: parcel.id,
  county: 'sangamon'
})

const title = await property.examineTitle({
  parcelId: parcel.id,
  deedIds: [deed.id],
  searchDepth: '60-years'
})

// Compile the full property report
await property.compilePropertyReport({
  parcelId: parcel.id,

  if (encumbrances.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'mortgage-underwriter',
      message: `Title examination found ${encumbrances.length} encumbrances on parcel ${parcelId}`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-compile report when all data is gathered
property.zoningObtained(async ({ parcelId }) => {
  await property.compilePropertyReport({ parcelId })
})
```
