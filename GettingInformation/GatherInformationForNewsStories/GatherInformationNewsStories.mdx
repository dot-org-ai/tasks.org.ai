### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { gatherInformationNewsStories } from '@headlessly/gather-information-news-stories'

const newsGathering = gatherInformationNewsStories()

// Identify a lead for a breaking story
const lead = await newsGathering.identifyLead({
  storyId: 'breaking-2026-0205',
  topic: 'city-council-budget-vote',
  angle: 'public-reaction-to-proposed-cuts',
  source: 'community-meeting-attendance'
})

// Contact source for interview
await newsGathering.contactSource({
  sourceId: 'SRC-4521',
  method: 'phone',
  purpose: 'interview-request',
  preferredTime: '2026-02-06T14:00:00Z'

  const documentNeeds = keyPoints.filter(p => p.requiresDocumentation)
  for (const need of documentNeeds) {
    await newsGathering.requestDocuments({
      storyId,
      documentTypes: [need.documentType],
      urgency: 'high'
    })
  }
})

// Alert editor when fact-check fails
newsGathering.factVerified(async ({ storyId, claim, result }) => {
  if (result === 'false' || result === 'unverifiable') {
    await notify({
      to: 'story-editor',
      message: `Fact check failed for story ${storyId}: "${claim}" - ${result}`
