## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { obtainWrittenAuthorizationPerformActivities } from '@headlessly/obtain-written-authorization-perform-activities'

const authorization = obtainWrittenAuthorizationPerformActivities()

// Identify what authorizations are needed
const requirements = await authorization.identifyRequirements({
  activity: 'Excavation for utility installation',
  location: '123 Main Street, Denver CO',
  duration: '2 weeks'
})

// Prepare and submit authorization request
const request = await authorization.prepareRequest({
  requirementId: requirements.id,
  documents: ['site-plan.pdf', 'insurance-cert.pdf', 'contractor-license.pdf'],
  requestedBy: 'John Smith',
  projectId: 'PROJ-2024-089'
})

await authorization.submitApplication({
  requestId: request.id,
  submittedTo: 'City Building Department'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-notify project team when authorization received
authorization.authorizationReceived(async ({ authorizationId, activity }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'project-team@company.com',
    subject: 'Work Authorization Approved',
    message: `Authorization for ${activity} has been granted. You may proceed with work.`
  })
})

// Alert when authorizations are expiring soon
authorization.getExpiring(async (expiring) => {
  for (const auth of expiring) {
    if (auth.daysUntilExpiry < 30) {
      await createTask({
        assignee: 'authorization-coordinator',
        title: `Renew authorization for ${auth.activity}`,
        dueDate: auth.expiryDate
      })
    }
  }
})
```
