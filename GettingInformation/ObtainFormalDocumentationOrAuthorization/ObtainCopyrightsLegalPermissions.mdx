### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { obtainCopyrightsLegalPermissions } from '@headlessly/obtain-copyrights-legal-permissions'

const permissions = obtainCopyrightsLegalPermissions()

// Identify content requiring permissions
const rights = await permissions.identifyRights({
  contentType: 'photograph',
  usage: 'commercial publication',
  metadata: { source: 'Getty Images', imageId: 'IMG-12345' }
})

// Locate rights holder and submit request
const holder = await permissions.locateHolder({
  rightsId: rights.id,
  searchDatabases: ['USPTO', 'Copyright Office']

await permissions.submitRequest({
  holderId: holder.id,
  usage: 'Print and digital marketing materials',
  territory: 'North America',

```typescript
// Auto-notify legal when permission is granted
permissions.permissionGranted(async ({ agreementId, rightsHolder }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'legal-compliance@company.com',
    subject: 'New Permission Granted',
    message: `Permission from ${rightsHolder} has been authorized. Agreement ID: ${agreementId}`
  })
})

// Alert if permission request expires without response
permissions.requestSubmitted(async ({ requestId, submittedDate }) => {
  const expiryDate = addDays(submittedDate, 30)
  await scheduleAlert({
    date: expiryDate,
    action: 'followUpOnPermissionRequest',
    params: { requestId }
  })
})
```
