## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { reviewProductionInformationDetermineCostume } from '@headlessly/review-production-information-determine-costume'

const production = reviewProductionInformationDetermineCostume()

// Analyze a script for costume and makeup cues
const analysis = await production.analyzeScript({
  productionId: 'hamlet-2026',
  scriptUrl: 'https://scripts.example.com.ai/hamlet-revised.pdf',
  acts: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
})

// Create a character breakdown for the lead role
const breakdown = await production.createCharacterBreakdown({
  productionId: 'hamlet-2026',
  character: 'Hamlet',
  scenes: analysis.scenesForCharacter('Hamlet'),
  periodReference: 'Elizabethan'
})

// Schedule fittings for the cast
await production.scheduleFittings({
  productionId: 'hamlet-2026',
  fittings: [
    { castMember: 'actor-001', character: 'Hamlet', date: '2026-03-10' },
    { castMember: 'actor-002', character: 'Ophelia', date: '2026-03-11' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify wardrobe when a script has been analyzed
production.scriptAnalyzed(async ({ productionId, totalScenes }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'wardrobe-team',
    message: `Script analysis complete for ${productionId}: ${totalScenes} scenes identified`
  })
})

// Auto-source materials after character breakdown is created
production.characterBreakdownCreated(async ({ productionId, character, materialNeeds }) => {
  await production.sourceMaterials({
    productionId,
    character,
    items: materialNeeds
  })
})
```
