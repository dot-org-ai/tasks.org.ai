### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { reviewArtDesignMaterials } from '@headlessly/review-art-design-materials'

const reviews = reviewArtDesignMaterials()

// Submit a new design asset for review
const asset = await reviews.submitDesign({
  projectId: 'campaign-q3-2026',
  fileName: 'hero-banner-v2.psd',
  fileUrl: 'https://assets.example.com/hero-banner-v2.psd',
  designer: 'jsmith'
})

// Evaluate the composition against brand guidelines
const evaluation = await reviews.evaluateComposition({
  assetId: asset.id,
  criteria: ['colorAccuracy', 'typographyConsistency', 'layoutBalance']
})

// Request a revision if needed
await reviews.requestRevision({
  assetId: asset.id,
  notes: 'Adjust headline kerning and increase contrast on CTA button'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify the art director when a new design is submitted
reviews.designSubmitted(async ({ assetId, projectId, designer }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'art-director',
    message: `New design submitted by ${designer} for project ${projectId}`
  })
})

// Auto-archive assets after approval
reviews.designApproved(async ({ assetId, approvedBy }) => {
  await reviews.archiveAsset({ assetId, archivedBy: approvedBy })
})
```
