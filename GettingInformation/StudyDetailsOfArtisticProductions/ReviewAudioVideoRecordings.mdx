# Review Audio or Video Recordings

> Business-as-Code definition for reviewing audio or video recordings. Models the evaluation workflow from media ingestion through quality assessment, annotation, and approval for distribution or archival.

## Overview

Reviewing audio or video recordings involves systematically evaluating media content for technical quality, artistic merit, compliance with production standards, and suitability for intended use. This includes assessing sound levels, visual clarity, editing continuity, and content accuracy. This definition exposes actions for each phase of media review, events for progress tracking, and searches for retrieving recordings and review history.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { reviewAudioVideoRecordings } from '@headlessly/review-audio-video-recordings'

const reviews = reviewAudioVideoRecordings()

// Ingest a new video recording for review
const recording = await reviews.ingestRecording({
  projectId: 'documentary-2026',
  title: 'Interview - Dr. Chen',
  mediaUrl: 'https://media.example.com/interview-chen-raw.mp4',
  format: 'ProRes 422'
})

// Assess technical quality
const quality = await reviews.assessQuality({
  recordingId: recording.id,
  checks: ['audioLevels', 'resolution', 'colorSpace', 'encoding']
})

// Annotate a specific timecode with feedback
await reviews.annotateTimecode({
  recordingId: recording.id,
  timecode: '00:14:32',
  note: 'Background noise spike - consider noise reduction or cutaway'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-generate transcripts when a recording is ingested
reviews.recordingIngested(async ({ recordingId, title }) => {
  await reviews.generateTranscript({ recordingId })
})

// Notify distribution when a recording is approved
reviews.recordingApproved(async ({ recordingId, projectId, title }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'distribution-team',
    message: `Recording approved: ${title} is ready for delivery`
  })
})
```
