# Read Technical Information Needed to Perform Maintenance or Repairs

> Business-as-Code definition for reading technical information needed to perform maintenance or repairs. Models the workflow from manual lookup through procedure identification, parts determination, and maintenance task preparation.

## Overview

Reading technical information for maintenance or repairs involves consulting service manuals, troubleshooting guides, technical bulletins, wiring diagrams, and parts catalogs to understand the correct procedures, safety precautions, torque specifications, and replacement parts for a given repair task. This definition exposes actions for technical document retrieval and interpretation, events for maintenance readiness tracking, and searches for locating procedures and parts data.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { readTechnicalInformationNeededPerform } from '@headlessly/read-technical-information-needed-perform'

const techDocs = readTechnicalInformationNeededPerform()

// Look up the service manual for a specific unit
const manual = await techDocs.lookupManual({
  equipmentModel: 'CAT-D6T',
  serialNumber: 'JJG00892',
  system: 'hydraulic'
})

// Identify the correct repair procedure from a diagnostic code
const procedure = await techDocs.identifyProcedure({
  manualId: manual.id,
  diagnosticCode: 'E362',
  symptom: 'hydraulic pressure loss'
})

// Extract the parts list for the procedure
const parts = await techDocs.extractPartsList({
  procedureId: procedure.id,
  includeConsumables: true
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify parts specialist when a parts list is extracted
techDocs.partsListExtracted(async ({ procedureId, parts }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'parts-specialist',
    message: `${parts.length} parts needed for procedure ${procedureId}`
  })
})

// Alert supervisor when maintenance preparation is complete
techDocs.maintenancePrepared(async ({ equipmentId, procedureId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'maintenance-supervisor',
    message: `Equipment ${equipmentId} is ready for repair - procedure ${procedureId}`
  })
})
```
