## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { obtainPersonalFinancialInformationAbout } from '@headlessly/obtain-personal-financial-information-about'

const financial = obtainPersonalFinancialInformationAbout()

// Request information from loan applicant
const request = await financial.requestInformation({
  applicantId: 'app-82374',
  requestedItems: [
    'government-id',
    'proof-of-income-last-2-years',
    'bank-statements-last-3-months',
    'tax-returns-last-2-years'
  ],
  purpose: 'mortgage-application',
  deadline: '2026-02-15T23:59:59Z'
})

// Collect submitted documents
await financial.collectDocument({
  requestId: request.id,
  documentType: 'government-id',
  format: 'pdf',
  fileHash: 'sha256:a4c8b...',
  uploadedAt: new Date().toISOString()
})

// Verify identity
const verification = await financial.verifyIdentity({
  applicantId: 'app-82374',
  documentId: 'doc-92847',
  method: 'document-verification-service',
  provider: 'trulioo'

  if (documentType === 'government-id') {
    await financial.verifyIdentity({
      applicantId,
      method: 'ocr-and-database-match'
    })
  }
})

// Encrypt all collected documents immediately
financial.documentCollected(async ({ documentId }) => {
  await financial.encryptData({
    documentId,
    algorithm: 'AES-256-GCM',
    keyRotationPolicy: 'quarterly'
  })
})

// Audit every access to sensitive data
financial.dataEncrypted(async ({ applicantId, documentId }) => {
  await financial.auditAccess({
    applicantId,
    documentId,
    accessor: 'system-automation',
    action: 'encryption-applied',
