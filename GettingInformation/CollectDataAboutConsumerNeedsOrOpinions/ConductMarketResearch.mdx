## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { conductMarketResearch } from '@headlessly/conduct-market-research'

const research = conductMarketResearch()

// Design a market sizing study
const study = await research.designStudy({
  title: 'Cloud Infrastructure Market Opportunity 2026',
  objectives: ['Size addressable market', 'Identify growth segments', 'Map competitive landscape'],
  methodology: 'mixed-methods',
  timeline: { start: '2026-02-01', end: '2026-04-30' }
})

// Recruit survey participants
await research.recruitParticipants({
  studyId: study.id,
  targetSegments: ['enterprise-it', 'devops-teams'],
  sampleSize: 300,
  criteria: { companySize: 'over-500-employees', role: 'technical-decision-maker' }
})

// Collect primary data
await research.collectPrimaryData({
  studyId: study.id,
  method: 'online-survey',
  instrument: 'market-needs-questionnaire-v2',
  distributionChannels: ['email', 'linkedin-ads']
})

// Analyze competitors
await research.analyzeCompetitors({
  studyId: study.id,
  competitors: ['aws', 'azure', 'gcp'],
  dimensions: ['pricing', 'feature-set', 'market-share', 'customer-satisfaction']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Trigger analysis when response threshold is met
research.primaryDataCollected(async ({ studyId }) => {
  const responses = await research.getParticipants({ studyId, status: 'completed' })
  if (responses.total >= 250) {
    await research.segmentMarket({ studyId })
  }
})

// Auto-deliver report when synthesis is complete
research.findingsSynthesized(async ({ studyId, findings }) => {
  await research.deliverReport({
    studyId,
    recipients: ['product-vp', 'marketing-vp', 'ceo'],
    format: 'executive-summary'
  })
})
```
