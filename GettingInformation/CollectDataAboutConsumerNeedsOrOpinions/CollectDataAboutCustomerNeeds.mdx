## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { collectDataAboutCustomerNeeds } from '@headlessly/collect-data-about-customer-needs'

const needs = collectDataAboutCustomerNeeds()

// Design customer needs assessment
const assessment = await needs.designAssessment({
  title: 'Q1 2026 Product Enhancement Survey',
  targetSegment: 'enterprise-customers',
  questions: [
    { id: 'q1', text: 'What features would improve your workflow?', type: 'open-ended' },
    { id: 'q2', text: 'Rate current reporting capabilities (1-5)', type: 'scale' },
    { id: 'q3', text: 'Which integrations are most important?', type: 'multiple-choice' }
  ]
})

// Launch campaign
await needs.launchCampaign({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  channels: ['email', 'in-app'],
  targetCount: 500,
  incentive: '25-dollar-gift-card'
})

// Capture customer response
await needs.captureResponse({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  customerId: 'cust-12847',
  responses: {
    q1: 'Bulk export to Excel with custom templates',
    q2: 3,
    q3: ['salesforce', 'tableau']
  }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-categorize responses as they arrive
needs.responseCaptured(async ({ response, assessmentId }) => {
  const categories = await categorizeText(response.responses.q1)
  await needs.categorizeNeeds({
    assessmentId,
    responseId: response.id,
    categories
  })
})

// Trigger analysis when target responses reached
needs.responseCaptured(async ({ assessmentId }) => {
  const count = await needs.getResponses({ assessmentId, status: 'completed' })
  if (count.total >= 500) {
    await needs.analyzeData({ assessmentId })
  }
})
```
