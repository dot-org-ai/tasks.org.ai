## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { adviseCustomersUseProductsServices } from '@headlessly/advise-customers-use-products-services'

const advisory = adviseCustomersUseProductsServices()

// Assess customer needs
const assessment = await advisory.assessNeeds({
  customerId: 'cust-456',
  product: 'Marketing Automation Platform',
  objectives: ['Increase email engagement', 'Automate lead scoring', 'Improve conversion rates'],
  currentState: 'Using basic email campaigns only'
})

// Recommend features for needs
const recommendation = await advisory.recommendFeatures({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  features: [
    'A/B testing',
    'Behavioral triggers',
    'Lead scoring automation',
    'Advanced segmentation'
  ],
  priority: 'High impact, easy to implement'
})

// Design workflow for lead nurturing
const workflow = await advisory.designWorkflow({
  customerId: 'cust-456',
  process: 'Lead nurturing',
  steps: [
    'Capture lead via form',
    'Score based on profile data',
    'Assign to segment',
    'Trigger email sequence',
    'Update score on engagement',
    'Notify sales at threshold'
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Schedule follow-up when implementation guided
advisory.implementationGuided(async ({ customerId, implementation }) => {
  const checkInDate = addDays(implementation.startDate, 7)
  await scheduleTask({
    date: checkInDate,
    action: 'Check implementation progress',
    assignedTo: implementation.advisorId,
    details: `Follow up on ${implementation.features.join(', ')}`
  })
})

// Alert on low adoption
advisory.adoptionMeasured(async ({ customerId, adoption }) => {
  if (adoption.activeUsers < adoption.licensedUsers * 0.5) {
    await notify({
      to: 'customer-success-team',
      priority: 'medium',
      message: `Customer ${customerId} has <50% user activation`,
      action: 'Schedule optimization consultation'
    })
  }
})
```
