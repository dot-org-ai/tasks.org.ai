```typescript
import { recommendProductsServicesCustomers } from '@headlessly/recommend-products-services-customers'

const recommendations = recommendProductsServicesCustomers()

// Assess customer needs
const needs = await recommendations.assessNeeds({
  customerId: 'cust_123',
  requirements: ['budget-friendly', 'high-performance', 'warranty'],
  budget: 5000,
  timeline: '30-days'
})

// Generate personalized recommendations
const options = await recommendations.generateRecommendations({
  customerId: 'cust_123',
  needsId: needs.id,
  maxOptions: 5,
  prioritize: 'value'
})

// Present solution to customer
await recommendations.presentSolution({

recommendations.outcomeTracked(async ({ customerId, recommendationId, accepted }) => {
  if (accepted) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      recommendations.followUp({
        customerId,
        recommendationId,
        method: 'email'
      })
    }, 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // 7 days
  }
})

// Alert specialists on complex requirements
recommendations.needsAssessed(async ({ customerId, requirements }) => {
  const complexityScore = calculateComplexity(requirements)
  if (complexityScore > 8) {
    await notify({
      to: 'product-specialists',
      message: `High-complexity customer needs assessment: ${customerId}`
