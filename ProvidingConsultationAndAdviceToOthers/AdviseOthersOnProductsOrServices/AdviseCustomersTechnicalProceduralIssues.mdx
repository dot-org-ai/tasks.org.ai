## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { adviseCustomersTechnicalProceduralIssues } from '@headlessly/advise-customers-technical-procedural-issues'

const advisory = adviseCustomersTechnicalProceduralIssues()

// Triage customer issue
const ticket = await advisory.triageIssue({
  customerId: 'cust-321',
  product: 'Enterprise Analytics Platform',
  issue: 'Unable to export dashboard to PDF',
  severity: 'Medium',
  impactedUsers: 1
})

// Diagnose root cause
const diagnosis = await advisory.diagnoseRoot({
  ticketId: ticket.id,
  reproductionSteps: ['Open dashboard', 'Click Export', 'Select PDF'],
  errorMessage: 'Export failed: timeout error',
  environment: 'Chrome 119, Windows 11'
})

// Provide solution
const solution = await advisory.provideSolution({
  ticketId: ticket.id,
  steps: [
    'Clear browser cache',
    'Disable browser extensions',
    'Reduce dashboard complexity by hiding unused widgets',
    'Retry export'
  ],
  estimatedTime: '5 minutes'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Send solution instructions when provided
advisory.solutionProvided(async ({ ticketId, solution }) => {
  await sendEmail({
    to: solution.customerEmail,
    subject: `Solution for Ticket ${ticketId}`,
    template: 'solution-steps',
    data: solution
  })
})

// Alert engineering on recurring issues
advisory.issueEscalated(async ({ ticketId, issue }) => {
  const similarTickets = await findTickets({ issue: issue.type, days: 7 })
  if (similarTickets.length > 5) {
    await createBug({
      assignedTo: 'product-team',
      title: `Recurring issue: ${issue.type}`,
      description: `${similarTickets.length} tickets in last 7 days`,
      priority: 'high'
    })
  }
})
```
