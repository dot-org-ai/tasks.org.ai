import { adviseRealEstateClients } from '@headlessly/advise-real-estate-clients'

const advisory = adviseRealEstateClients()

// Evaluate investment property
const evaluation = await advisory.evaluateProperty({
  propertyId: 'prop-456',
  clientGoal: 'Long-term rental income',
  analysisType: 'Investment cashflow'
})

// Analyze local market
const market = await advisory.analyzeMarket({
  location: 'Austin, TX',
  propertyType: 'Multi-family',

  await sendEmail({
    to: clientId,
    subject: 'Market Analysis Complete',
    template: 'market-report',
    data: analysis
  })
})

// Alert team when offer accepted
advisory.termsNegotiated(async ({ transactionId, terms }) => {
  if (terms.status === 'accepted') {
    await notify({
      to: 'transaction-team',
      priority: 'high',
      message: `Offer accepted on transaction ${transactionId}. Begin inspection coordination.`
