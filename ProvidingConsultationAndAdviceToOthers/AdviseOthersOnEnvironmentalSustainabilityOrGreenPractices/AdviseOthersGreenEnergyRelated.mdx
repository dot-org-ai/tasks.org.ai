## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { adviseOthersGreenEnergyRelated } from '@headlessly/advise-others-green-energy-related'

const advisory = adviseOthersGreenEnergyRelated()

// Conduct energy audit for commercial facility
const audit = await advisory.conductAudit({
  clientId: 'client-456',
  facilityType: 'Manufacturing',
  annualConsumption: 850000,
  peakDemand: 250
})

// Assess technology suitability
const assessment = await advisory.assessSuitability({
  auditId: audit.id,
  siteCharacteristics: {
    roofArea: 50000,
    orientation: 'South-facing',
    shading: 'Minimal'
  }
})

// Design solar system
const system = await advisory.designSystem({
  technology: 'Solar PV',
  capacity: 500,
  budget: 1200000
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Generate report when savings calculated
advisory.savingsCalculated(async ({ systemId, projections }) => {
  await generateReport({
    type: 'Financial Analysis',
    data: projections,
    format: 'PDF',
    recipients: [projections.clientEmail]
  })
})

// Alert when high-value incentives identified
advisory.incentivesIdentified(async ({ systemId, incentives }) => {
  const total = incentives.reduce((sum, i) => sum + i.amount, 0)
  if (total > 100000) {
    await notify({
      to: 'sales-team',
      priority: 'high',
      message: `Major incentive opportunity: ${formatCurrency(total)}`
    })
  }
})
```
