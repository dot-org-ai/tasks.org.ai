## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { adviseOthersAboutLandManagement } from '@headlessly/advise-others-about-land-management'

const advisory = adviseOthersAboutLandManagement()

// Assess a property for conservation potential
const assessment = await advisory.assessProperty({
  propertyId: 'prop-789',
  acreage: 450,
  currentUse: 'Mixed agriculture and forest',
  ownerGoals: ['Habitat restoration', 'Water quality']
})

// Identify critical habitats
const habitats = await advisory.identifyHabitats({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  surveys: ['wildlife', 'wetlands', 'forestry']
})

// Develop conservation plan
const plan = await advisory.developPlan({
  propertyId: 'prop-789',
  priorities: ['Riparian buffer restoration', 'Native grassland establishment'],
  timeline: '5-year implementation'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify stakeholders when assessment completes
advisory.propertyAssessed(async ({ propertyId, assessment }) => {
  await notify({
    to: assessment.owner,
    message: `Property assessment complete. ${assessment.opportunities.length} conservation opportunities identified.`
  })
})

// Flag compliance issues
advisory.complianceReviewed(async ({ planId, status }) => {
  if (status.violations.length > 0) {
    await escalate({
      to: 'compliance-team',
      issue: `Plan ${planId} has ${status.violations.length} regulatory concerns`
    })
  }
})
```
