## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { adviseOthersManagementEmergenciesHazardous } from '@headlessly/advise-others-management-emergencies-hazardous'

const emergency = adviseOthersManagementEmergenciesHazardous()

// Assess hazardous materials on-site
const assessment = await emergency.assessHazardousMaterials({
  facilityId: 'facility_789',
  substances: [
    { name: 'sulfuric-acid', quantity: 500, unit: 'gallons', storage: 'corrosive-cabinet' },
    { name: 'ammonia', quantity: 200, unit: 'pounds', storage: 'pressurized-tank' }
  ],
  assessmentDate: '2026-02-05'
})

// Develop emergency response plan
const plan = await emergency.developEmergencyPlan({
  facilityId: 'facility_789',
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  scenarios: ['chemical-spill', 'fire', 'gas-release', 'explosion'],
  evacuationRoutes: true,
  incidentCommand: 'ics-structure'
})

// Train response teams
await emergency.trainResponseTeams({
  planId: plan.id,
  teams: ['emergency-response-team', 'hazmat-team', 'first-aid-team'],
  topics: ['incident-command', 'spill-containment', 'evacuation-procedures'],
  duration: 480
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Activate incident command during emergencies
emergency.incidentGuidanceProvided(async ({ facilityId, scenario, severity }) => {
  if (severity === 'critical') {
    await emergency.coordinateResponse({
      facilityId,
      scenario,
      activateICS: true,
      notifyAgencies: ['fire-department', 'hazmat-team', 'environmental-agency']
    })
  }
})

// Schedule debrief after drills
emergency.drillConducted(async ({ facilityId, scenario, participants }) => {
  const debriefDate = addDays(new Date(), 3)
  await scheduleTask({
    task: 'Emergency drill debrief meeting',
    assignee: 'emergency-coordinator',
    dueDate: debriefDate,
    facilityId,
    participants
  })
})
```
