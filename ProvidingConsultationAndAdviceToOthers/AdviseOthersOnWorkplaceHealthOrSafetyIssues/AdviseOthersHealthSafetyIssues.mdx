## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { adviseOthersHealthSafetyIssues } from '@headlessly/advise-others-health-safety-issues'

const safety = adviseOthersHealthSafetyIssues()

// Assess workplace risks
const assessment = await safety.assessRisks({
  location: 'manufacturing-floor-2',
  scope: ['machinery', 'chemical-exposure', 'ergonomics', 'noise'],
  assessmentDate: '2026-02-05',
  assessorId: 'safety_123'
})

// Recommend hazard controls
const controls = await safety.recommendControls({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  hazards: ['moving-machinery', 'chemical-vapors'],
  hierarchy: ['elimination', 'substitution', 'engineering', 'administrative', 'ppe'],
  budget: 50000
})

// Conduct safety training
const training = await safety.conductTraining({
  topic: 'chemical-handling-safety',
  audience: ['production-staff', 'maintenance-team'],
  format: 'classroom',
  duration: 120,
  trainerBefore: 'trainer_456'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-investigate high-severity incidents
safety.incidentInvestigated(async ({ incidentId, severity, injuries }) => {
  if (severity === 'serious' || injuries > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'safety-committee',
      priority: 'urgent',
      message: `Serious workplace incident requires immediate investigation: ${incidentId}`
    })
    await safety.assessRisks({
      location: incident.location,
      trigger: 'incident-investigation'
    })
  }
})

// Schedule refresher training
safety.trainingConducted(async ({ topic, participants, completionDate }) => {
  const refresherDate = addMonths(completionDate, 12)
  await scheduleTask({
    task: `Refresher training: ${topic}`,
    assignee: 'safety-trainer',
    dueDate: refresherDate,
    participants
  })
})
```
