```typescript
import { advisePatientsHealthcareSystemProcesses } from '@headlessly/advise-patients-healthcare-system-processes'

const navigation = advisePatientsHealthcareSystemProcesses()

// Receive patient inquiry
const inquiry = await navigation.receiveInquiry({
  patientId: 'patient_789',
  topic: 'specialist-referral',
  question: 'How do I see a cardiologist for my heart condition?',
  urgency: 'routine'
})

// Explain healthcare process
await navigation.explainProcess({
  inquiryId: inquiry.id,
  topics: ['referral-process', 'insurance-authorization', 'specialist-selection'],
  method: 'phone-call',
  duration: 20
})

// Facilitate specialist referral
const referral = await navigation.facilitateReferral({
  patientId: 'patient_789',
  specialty: 'cardiology',
  requestingPhysician: 'physician_123',
  insuranceId: 'ins_456',
  urgency: 'routine'
})
```

// Auto-verify insurance after referral
navigation.referralFacilitated(async ({ patientId, referralId, specialty }) => {
  await navigation.verifyInsurance({
    patientId,
    referralId,
    serviceType: specialty,
    checkAuthorization: true
  })
})

// Follow up on pending appointments
navigation.appointmentsCoordinated(async ({ patientId, appointmentDate }) => {
  const reminderDate = subtractDays(appointmentDate, 3)
  await scheduleTask({
    task: 'Send appointment reminder to patient',
    assignee: 'patient-navigator',
    dueDate: reminderDate,
    patientId
  })
})
```
