## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { adviseMedicalPersonnelRegardingHealthcare } from '@headlessly/advise-medical-personnel-regarding-healthcare'

const advisory = adviseMedicalPersonnelRegardingHealthcare()

// Review complex cardiac case
const review = await advisory.reviewCase({
  requestingPhysician: 'dr-smith',
  specialty: 'Cardiology',
  presentation: 'Recurrent syncope with negative initial workup',
  patientAge: 67,
  comorbidities: ['Type 2 diabetes', 'Hypertension'],
  priorStudies: ['ECG', 'Echocardiogram', 'Holter monitor']
})

// Provide consultation
const consultation = await advisory.provideConsultation({
  caseId: review.id,
  consultantSpecialty: 'Electrophysiology',
  urgency: 'Routine'
})

// Recommend treatment approach
const recommendation = await advisory.recommendTreatment({
  consultationId: consultation.id,
  diagnosis: 'Suspected intermittent complete heart block',
  treatment: 'Implantable loop recorder followed by pacemaker if confirmed',
  rationale: 'High-risk features warrant prolonged monitoring'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify physician when consultation complete
advisory.consultationProvided(async ({ caseId, consultation }) => {
  await sendSecureMessage({
    to: consultation.requestingPhysician,
    subject: 'Specialist Consultation Complete',
    message: consultation.summary,
    priority: consultation.urgency
  })
})

// Trigger protocol review on quality gaps
advisory.qualityAssessed(async ({ protocolId, assessment }) => {
  if (assessment.adherenceRate < 80) {
    await createTask({
      assignedTo: 'quality-team',
      title: `Review protocol ${protocolId}`,
      description: `Adherence rate ${assessment.adherenceRate}% below target`,
      dueDate: addDays(new Date(), 7)
    })
  }
})
```
