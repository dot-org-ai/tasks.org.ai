## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { adviseCommunitiesInstitutionsRegardingHealth } from '@headlessly/advise-communities-institutions-regarding-health'

const advisory = adviseCommunitiesInstitutionsRegardingHealth()

// Assess community health needs
const assessment = await advisory.assessNeeds({
  communityId: 'community-456',
  population: 85000,
  dataSource: ['Hospital records', 'Survey', 'Census'],
  priorities: ['Chronic disease', 'Mental health', 'Access to care']
})

// Identify at-risk populations
const risks = await advisory.identifyRisks({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  factors: ['Diabetes prevalence', 'Food insecurity', 'Lack of insurance']
})

// Develop diabetes prevention program
const program = await advisory.developProgram({
  communityId: 'community-456',
  target: 'Adults with pre-diabetes',
  intervention: 'Lifestyle modification program',
  duration: '12 months',
  partners: ['YMCA', 'Local clinics']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Generate report when needs assessment completes
advisory.needsAssessed(async ({ communityId, assessment }) => {
  await generateReport({
    template: 'community-health-needs',
    data: assessment,
    deliverTo: assessment.stakeholders
  })
})

// Alert on adverse health trends
advisory.outcomesMonitored(async ({ communityId, outcomes }) => {
  const worsening = outcomes.metrics.filter(m => m.trend === 'declining')
  if (worsening.length > 0) {
    await escalate({
      to: 'public-health-director',
      severity: 'high',
      message: `${worsening.length} health metrics declining in ${communityId}`
    })
  }
})
```
