## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { adviseOthersOnHealthcareMatters } from '@headlessly/advise-others-on-healthcare-matters'

const advisor = adviseOthersOnHealthcareMatters()

// Assess healthcare needs for a facility
const assessment = await advisor.assessHealthcareNeeds({
  facility: 'Regional Medical Center',
  department: 'Emergency Medicine',
  concerns: ['patient-wait-times', 'readmission-rates', 'sepsis-protocol-adherence']
})

// Deliver a clinical recommendation
await advisor.deliverClinicalRecommendation({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  topic: 'Sepsis Early Detection Protocol',
  recommendation: 'Implement qSOFA scoring at triage for all patients presenting with suspected infection',
  evidenceBasis: 'Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2024 Guidelines',
  urgency: 'high'
})

// Review an existing care protocol
await advisor.reviewCareProtocol({
  protocolId: 'PROTO-SEPSIS-V3',

  })
})

// Schedule outcome evaluation after recommendation implementation

  await scheduleTask({
    action: 'evaluateAdvisoryOutcome',
    assessmentId,
    topic,
    delay: '60d'
  })
})
```
