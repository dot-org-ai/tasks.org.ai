```typescript
import { adviseAthletesCoachesTrainersExercise } from '@headlessly/advise-athletes-coaches-trainers-exercise'

const advisory = adviseAthletesCoachesTrainersExercise()

// Assess athlete baseline fitness
const assessment = await advisory.assessFitness({
  athleteId: 'athlete-789',
  sport: 'Basketball',
  tests: ['VO2Max', 'Vertical Jump', '1RM Squat', 'Sprint Time'],
  goals: ['Increase explosiveness', 'Improve endurance']
})

// Design 12-week training program

  athleteId: 'athlete-789',
  phase: 'Off-season strength',
  duration: 12,
  frequency: 5,
  focus: ['Power development', 'Functional movement']
})

      date: session.scheduledDate,
      message: `Today's workout: ${session.focus}`,
      details: session.exercises
    })
  }
})

// Alert on plateau
advisory.progressMonitored(async ({ athleteId, progress }) => {
  if (progress.weeksSinceImprovement > 3) {
    await notify({
      to: progress.advisorId,
      priority: 'medium',
      message: `Athlete ${athleteId} showing training plateau. Consider protocol adjustment.`
