      priority: 'critical',
      message: `Immediate response needed for client ${clientId} - active suicidal intent with means and plan`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-schedule follow-up after crisis de-escalation
crisisIntervention.safetyPlanDeveloped(async ({ clientId, safetyPlan }) => {
  await schedule({
    type: 'crisis-follow-up',
    clientId,
    scheduledDate: addHours(new Date(), 24),
    purpose: 'Verify client safety and adherence to safety plan'
