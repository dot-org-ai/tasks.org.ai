# Discuss Child Development Behavior Parents

> Business-as-Code definition for child development and behavior discussions with parents or guardians. Models the process of observing children, documenting developmental milestones, communicating findings to families, and coordinating support strategies.

## Overview

Discussing child development and behavior with parents or guardians involves systematically observing children, assessing developmental progress against age-appropriate milestones, and communicating findings and recommendations to families. This definition covers the full communication cycle from developmental observation through parent conference preparation, meeting facilitation, and collaborative action planning. It supports early childhood educators, pediatric professionals, child psychologists, and social workers who engage families in understanding and supporting their children's growth.

| Child | The individual whose development and behavior are being observed and discussed |
| Pediatrician | Provides medical context for developmental milestones and behavioral patterns |
| ChildCareProvider | Observes daily behavior and development in caregiving settings |
| SpecialEducationTeam | Evaluates children for developmental delays and provides targeted services |

## Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| DevelopmentalSpecialist | Assesses child development and communicates findings to families |
| EarlyChildhoodEducator | Observes children in classroom settings and prepares developmental reports |
| BehaviorConsultant | Analyzes behavioral patterns and recommends management strategies |

| scheduleConference | Arrange a meeting with parents or guardians to discuss findings |
| conductConference | Facilitate a discussion with families about development and behavior |
| createActionPlan | Collaboratively develop strategies for supporting the child |
| followUpOnProgress | Check in with families on implementation of agreed-upon strategies |

## Events

| Event | Description |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { discussChildDevelopmentBehaviorParents } from '@headlessly/discuss-child-development-behavior-parents'

const childDev = discussChildDevelopmentBehaviorParents()

// Observe development
const observation = await childDev.observeDevelopment({
  childId: 'child-0847',
  ageMonths: 36,
  domains: ['language', 'motor-skills', 'social-emotional', 'cognitive'],
  setting: 'preschool-classroom'
})

// Assess milestones
const assessment = await childDev.assessMilestones({
  observationId: observation.id,
  checklist: 'CDC-developmental-milestones',
  findings: {
    language: 'on-track',
    motorSkills: 'on-track',
    socialEmotional: 'area-of-concern',
    cognitive: 'on-track'
  }
})

// Schedule conference with parent
await childDev.scheduleConference({
  childId: 'child-0847',
  parentId: 'parent-0847',
  topics: ['social-emotional-development', 'peer-interaction-patterns'],
  preferredDates: ['2026-03-10', '2026-03-12']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert team when significant developmental concerns arise
childDev.milestonesAssessed(async ({ childId, domains, concerns }) => {
  if (concerns.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'developmental-team',
      message: `Milestone concerns for child ${childId}: ${concerns.join(', ')}`
    })
  }
})

// Remind families about follow-up
childDev.actionPlanCreated(async ({ childId, parentId, reviewDate }) => {
  await scheduleReminder({
    to: parentId,
    date: addDays(new Date(reviewDate), -3),
    message: `Upcoming progress check on your child's development plan`
  })
})
```
