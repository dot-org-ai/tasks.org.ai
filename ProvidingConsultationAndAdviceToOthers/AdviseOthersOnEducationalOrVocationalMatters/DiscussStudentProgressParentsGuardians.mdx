## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { discussStudentProgressParentsGuardians } from '@headlessly/discuss-student-progress-parents-guardians'

const progress = discussStudentProgressParentsGuardians()

// Compile progress data
const data = await progress.compileProgressData({
  studentId: 'student-1192',
  reportingPeriod: 'Q2-2026',
  subjects: ['Math', 'English', 'Science', 'History']
})

// Prepare progress report
const report = await progress.prepareProgressReport({
  studentId: 'student-1192',
  dataId: data.id,
  includeAttendance: true,
  includeBehavioralNotes: true
})

// Schedule conference
await progress.scheduleConference({
  studentId: 'student-1192',
  parentId: 'parent-1192',
  reportId: report.id,
  proposedDates: ['2026-03-18T15:00', '2026-03-19T16:00'],
  format: 'in-person'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify parents when progress reports are ready
progress.progressReportPrepared(async ({ studentId, parentId, reportingPeriod }) => {
  await notify({
    to: parentId,
    message: `Your student's ${reportingPeriod} progress report is ready for review`
  })
})

// Flag students needing intervention
progress.progressDataCompiled(async ({ studentId, subjects }) => {
  const declining = subjects.filter(s => s.trend === 'declining')
  if (declining.length >= 2) {
    await notify({
      to: 'academic-support-team',
      message: `Student ${studentId} showing decline in ${declining.map(s => s.name).join(', ')}`
    })
  }
})
```
