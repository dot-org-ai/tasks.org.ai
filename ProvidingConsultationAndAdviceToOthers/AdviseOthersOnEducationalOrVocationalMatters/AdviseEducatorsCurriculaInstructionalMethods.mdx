## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { adviseEducatorsOnCurriculaAndInstructionalMethods } from '@headlessly/advise-educators-on-curricula-and-instructional-methods'

const advisor = adviseEducatorsOnCurriculaAndInstructionalMethods()

// Assess curriculum needs for a school district
const assessment = await advisor.assessCurriculumNeeds({
  district: 'Westfield Unified',
  gradeLevel: 'K-8',
  subjectArea: 'Mathematics',
  includeStudentOutcomes: true
})

// Recommend curriculum changes
await advisor.recommendCurriculumChanges({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  recommendations: [
    { area: 'Problem-Based Learning', priority: 'high', rationale: 'Student engagement scores below benchmark' },
    { area: 'Formative Assessment Integration', priority: 'medium', rationale: 'Limited ongoing progress monitoring' }
  ]
})

// Design professional development to support changes
await advisor.designProfessionalDevelopment({
  topic: 'Implementing Problem-Based Learning in Mathematics',
  targetAudience: 'middle-school-math-teachers',
  format: 'workshop-series',
  sessions: 6
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify administrators when curriculum changes are proposed
advisor.curriculumChangesRecommended(async ({ district, subjectArea, recommendations }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'curriculum-committee',
    message: `New curriculum recommendations for ${subjectArea} in ${district}: ${recommendations.length} changes proposed`
  })
})

// Schedule outcome evaluation after implementation
advisor.professionalDevelopmentDesigned(async ({ topic, targetAudience }) => {
  await scheduleTask({
    action: 'evaluateOutcomes',
    topic,
    targetAudience,
    delay: '90d'
  })
})
```
