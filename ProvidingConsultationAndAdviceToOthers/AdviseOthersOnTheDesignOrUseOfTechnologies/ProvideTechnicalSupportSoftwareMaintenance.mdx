| Developer | Engineers maintaining and fixing software |
| Vendor | Provides commercial software and updates |
| QAEngineer | Tests software fixes and patches |
| ProductManager | Prioritizes feature requests and bug fixes |

## Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ApplicationSupport | Handles software-specific troubleshooting |
| PatchCoordinator | Manages software update deployment |
| BugTriager | Categorizes and prioritizes defect reports |
| KnowledgeManager | Maintains support documentation |

## Entities

| Entity | Description |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { provideTechnicalSupportSoftwareMaintenance } from '@headlessly/provide-technical-support-software-maintenance'

const softwareSupport = provideTechnicalSupportSoftwareMaintenance()

// Create support case
const supportCase = await softwareSupport.createCase({
  userId: 'user_456',
  software: 'erp-system',
  module: 'inventory-management',
  issue: 'Stock count report showing incorrect values',
  severity: 'high',
  impact: 'Affects monthly audit process'
})

// Reproduce and verify bug
const bug = await softwareSupport.reproduceBug({
  caseId: supportCase.id,
  steps: ['Navigate to Reports > Inventory > Stock Count', 'Select date range', 'Generate report'],
  expected: 'Report shows accurate stock counts',
  actual: 'Report shows values 10% lower than database query',
  environment: { version: '5.2.1', database: 'postgresql-14' }
})

// Provide temporary workaround
await softwareSupport.provideWorkaround({
  caseId: supportCase.id,
  bugId: bug.id,
  solution: 'Use legacy report template from Reports > Legacy > Stock Count until patch is available',
  limitations: 'Legacy template does not support multi-warehouse filtering'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-escalate critical bugs
softwareSupport.bugReproduced(async ({ bugId, severity, impact }) => {
  if (severity === 'critical' || impact === 'system-wide') {
    await softwareSupport.escalateToDevelopment({
      bugId,
      priority: 'urgent',
      assignee: 'on-call-developer'
    })
  }
})

// Notify users when patch is available
softwareSupport.patchApplied(async ({ software, version, affectedUsers }) => {
  await softwareSupport.publishReleaseNotes({
    software,
    version,
    fixes: await getBugsByVersion(version),
    distribution: affectedUsers
  })
})
```
