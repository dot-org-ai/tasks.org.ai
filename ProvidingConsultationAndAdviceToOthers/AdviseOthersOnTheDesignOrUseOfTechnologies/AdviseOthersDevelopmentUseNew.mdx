## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { adviseOthersDevelopmentUseNew } from '@headlessly/advise-others-development-use-new'

const advisory = adviseOthersDevelopmentUseNew()

// Assess emerging technology
const assessment = await advisory.assessTechnology({
  clientId: 'client_456',
  technology: 'generative-ai',
  useCases: ['customer-service', 'content-creation', 'code-generation'],
  currentState: 'exploring-options'
})

// Analyze organizational readiness
const readiness = await advisory.analyzeReadiness({
  clientId: 'client_456',
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  factors: ['technical-skills', 'budget', 'infrastructure', 'culture']
})

// Develop strategic recommendation
const recommendation = await advisory.developRecommendation({
  clientId: 'client_456',
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  readinessId: readiness.id,
  approach: 'phased-pilot',
  timeline: '12-months',
  budget: 500000
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on high-risk technology adoptions
advisory.risksIdentified(async ({ clientId, technologyId, risks }) => {
  const highRisks = risks.filter(r => r.severity === 'high')
  if (highRisks.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'advisory-leadership',
      priority: 'high',
      message: `High-risk technology adoption: ${technologyId} for ${clientId}`
    })
  }
})

// Schedule training after implementation plan approval
advisory.implementationPlanned(async ({ clientId, technologyId, phases }) => {
  await advisory.designTraining({
    clientId,
    technologyId,
    audiences: ['end-users', 'administrators', 'support-staff'],
    delivery: 'hybrid'
  })
})
```
