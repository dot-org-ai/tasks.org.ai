## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { provideTechnicalGuidancePersonnel } from '@headlessly/provide-technical-guidance-personnel'

const guidance = provideTechnicalGuidancePersonnel()

// Receive guidance request
const request = await guidance.receiveRequest({
  menteeId: 'emp_456',
  topic: 'kubernetes-deployment',
  type: 'troubleshooting',
  urgency: 'high',
  context: 'Production deployment failing on pod startup'
})

// Provide hands-on mentoring
const session = await guidance.provideMentoring({
  requestId: request.id,
  mentorId: 'emp_789',
  duration: 60,
  approach: 'pair-programming',
  topics: ['container-debugging', 'log-analysis', 'resource-limits']
})

// Create development plan
const plan = await guidance.createDevelopmentPlan({
  menteeId: 'emp_456',
  skillGaps: ['kubernetes-advanced', 'observability', 'performance-tuning'],
  timeline: '6-months',
  milestones: ['certification', 'production-deployment', 'architecture-design']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Assign mentor based on expertise
guidance.requestReceived(async ({ menteeId, topic, urgency }) => {
  const mentor = await findExpert({ topic, availability: 'immediate' })
  await notify({
    to: mentor.id,
    priority: urgency,
    message: `New guidance request: ${topic} from ${menteeId}`
  })
})

// Schedule follow-up after mentoring
guidance.mentoringProvided(async ({ menteeId, sessionId, topics }) => {
  const followUpDate = addWeeks(new Date(), 2)
  await scheduleTask({
    assignee: 'mentor',
    task: 'Follow up on skill development',
    dueDate: followUpDate,
    menteeId,
    topics
  })
})
```
