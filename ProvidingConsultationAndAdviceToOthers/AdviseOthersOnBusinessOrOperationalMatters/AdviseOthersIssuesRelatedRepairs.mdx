# Advise Others Issues Related Repairs

> Business-as-Code definition for technical advisory services on repairs, installation, and equipment design. Models the process of diagnosing issues, recommending solutions, and guiding maintenance and installation decisions.

## Overview

Advising others on issues related to repairs, installation, or equipment design involves providing expert technical guidance to maintenance crews, installation teams, engineers, and facility managers. This definition covers the full advisory lifecycle from initial problem assessment through solution recommendation and verification of corrective actions. It enables structured consultation on equipment failures, installation best practices, and design modifications to improve reliability and performance.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { adviseOthersIssuesRelatedRepairs } from '@headlessly/advise-others-issues-related-repairs'

const techAdvisory = adviseOthersIssuesRelatedRepairs()

// Report a technical issue
const issue = await techAdvisory.reportTechnicalIssue({
  equipment: 'HVAC-Unit-3B',
  facility: 'Building 7',
  symptoms: 'Intermittent cooling failure during peak load',
  severity: 'high'
})

// Diagnose the equipment problem
const diagnosis = await techAdvisory.diagnoseEquipment({
  issueId: issue.id,
  dataPoints: ['compressor-pressure', 'refrigerant-level', 'thermostat-readings']
})

// Recommend specific repair
await techAdvisory.recommendRepair({
  issueId: issue.id,
  procedure: 'Replace expansion valve and recharge refrigerant',
  parts: [{ partNumber: 'EXV-4420', quantity: 1 }],
  estimatedDowntime: '4 hours'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert facility manager on critical diagnoses
techAdvisory.diagnosisCompleted(async ({ issueId, rootCause, severity }) => {
  if (severity === 'critical') {
    await notify({
      to: 'facility-manager',
      message: `Critical equipment diagnosis: ${rootCause}`
    })
  }
})

// Schedule verification after repair recommendation
techAdvisory.repairRecommended(async ({ issueId, estimatedDowntime }) => {
  await scheduleVerification({
    issueId,
    verifyAfter: addHours(new Date(), parseInt(estimatedDowntime) + 2)
  })
})
```
