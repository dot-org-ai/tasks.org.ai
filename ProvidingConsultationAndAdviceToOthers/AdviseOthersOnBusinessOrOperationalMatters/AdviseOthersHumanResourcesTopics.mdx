## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { adviseOthersHumanResourcesTopics } from '@headlessly/advise-others-human-resources-topics'

const hrAdvisory = adviseOthersHumanResourcesTopics()

// Submit a new advisory request
const request = await hrAdvisory.submitAdvisoryRequest({
  topic: 'Remote Work Policy Compliance',
  requester: 'operations-director',
  urgency: 'medium',
  description: 'Need guidance on updating remote work policies for multi-state employees'
})

// Assess compliance against current regulations
const assessment = await hrAdvisory.assessHRCompliance({
  requestId: request.id,
  jurisdiction: ['CA', 'NY', 'TX'],
  policyArea: 'remote-work'
})

// Deliver formal guidance
await hrAdvisory.deliverGuidance({
  requestId: request.id,
  recommendations: [
    { area: 'Tax Withholding', action: 'Register for payroll tax in each employee state' },
    { area: 'Workers Compensation', action: 'Obtain coverage in all applicable jurisdictions' }

// Notify legal when complex compliance issues arise
hrAdvisory.escalationTriggered(async ({ requestId, topic, complexity }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'legal-team',
    message: `HR advisory escalation: ${topic} requires legal review`,
    priority: complexity
  })
})

// Follow up on unimplemented recommendations
hrAdvisory.guidanceDelivered(async ({ requestId, recommendations }) => {
  await scheduleFollowUp({
    requestId,
    checkDate: addDays(new Date(), 30),
    items: recommendations.map(r => r.area)
  })
})
```
