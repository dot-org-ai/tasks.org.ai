  operatorId: 'farmer_johnson',
  operationType: 'row-crop',
  acreage: 500,
  currentPractices: ['corn', 'soybeans', 'conventional-tillage']
})

// Recommend crop management

advisory.cropManagementRecommended(async ({ operatorId, practiceChanges }) => {
  if (practiceChanges.includes('no-till')) {
    await advisory.recommendEquipment({
      operatorId,
      equipmentType: 'no-till-planter',
      includeFinancing: true
    })
  }
})

// Track sustainability certifications
advisory.sustainabilityPlanDeveloped(async ({ operatorId, certificationEligible }) => {
  if (certificationEligible.includes('organic')) {
    await notify({
      to: operatorId,
      message: 'Your sustainability plan qualifies for organic certification'
