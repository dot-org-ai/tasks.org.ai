# Recommend Organizational Process Policy Changes

> Business-as-Code definition for recommending organizational process and policy changes. Models the lifecycle of identifying improvement needs, drafting policy proposals, managing stakeholder review, and tracking adoption.

## Overview

Recommending organizational process or policy changes involves analyzing current operational procedures, identifying gaps or inefficiencies, and proposing formal modifications to policies, workflows, or governance structures.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { recommendOrganizationalProcessPolicyChanges } from '@headlessly/recommend-organizational-process-policy-changes'

const policyChange = recommendOrganizationalProcessPolicyChanges()

// Assess current expense approval policy
const assessment = await policyChange.assessCurrentPolicy({
  policyArea: 'Expense Approval',
  scope: ['Finance', 'Operations', 'Sales'],
  criteria: ['efficiency', 'compliance', 'employee-satisfaction']
})

// Draft a policy proposal
const proposal = await policyChange.draftPolicyProposal({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  title: 'Streamlined Expense Approval Thresholds',
  summary: 'Increase manager-level approval limit from $500 to $2,000 to reduce bottlenecks',
  currentPolicy: 'All expenses over $500 require VP approval',
  proposedChange: 'Expenses under $2,000 approved at manager level; $2,000+ requires VP approval',
  rationale: 'Current threshold creates 3-day average approval delay for routine expenses'
})

// Conduct impact assessment
await policyChange.conductImpactAssessment({
  proposalId: proposal.id,
  dimensions: ['processing-time', 'risk-exposure', 'employee-experience']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify leadership when proposals are ready for approval
policyChange.impactAssessmentCompleted(async ({ proposalId, riskLevel }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'executive-leadership',
    message: `Policy proposal ready for review (risk level: ${riskLevel})`,
    link: `/proposals/${proposalId}`
  })
})

// Schedule adoption review after implementation
policyChange.policyChangeImplemented(async ({ proposalId, policyArea }) => {
  await scheduleReview({
    proposalId,
    reviewDate: addDays(new Date(), 90),
    type: 'adoption-monitoring',
    area: policyArea
  })
})
```
