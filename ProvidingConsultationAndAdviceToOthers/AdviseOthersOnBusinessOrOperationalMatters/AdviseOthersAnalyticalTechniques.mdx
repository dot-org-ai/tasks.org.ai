## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { adviseOthersAnalyticalTechniques } from '@headlessly/advise-others-analytical-techniques'

const advisory = adviseOthersAnalyticalTechniques()

// Assess analytical needs
const assessment = await advisory.assessAnalyticalNeeds({
  businessProblem: 'Forecast quarterly sales by region',
  dataAvailability: '5 years historical sales data',
  constraints: ['limited statistical expertise', 'monthly refresh required']
})

// Recommend technique
const recommendation = await advisory.recommendTechnique({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  techniques: ['time-series-regression', 'arima', 'prophet']
})

// Train team on recommended approach
await advisory.trainOnTechnique({
  technique: 'prophet',
  audience: 'sales-analytics-team',
  format: 'workshop'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-schedule training on new recommendations
advisory.techniqueRecommended(async ({ technique, audience, complexity }) => {
  if (complexity === 'advanced') {
    await advisory.trainOnTechnique({
      technique,
      audience,
      duration: '2-days'
    })
  }
})

// Document successful approaches
advisory.approachValidated(async ({ technique, useCase, effectiveness }) => {
  if (effectiveness > 0.85) {
    await advisory.documentBestPractices({
      technique,
      useCase,
      recommendedFor: 'similar-business-problems'
    })
  }
})
```
