### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { adviseOthersOnLegalOrRegulatoryCompliance } from '@headlessly/advise-others-on-legal-or-regulatory-compliance'

const advisor = adviseOthersOnLegalOrRegulatoryCompliance()

// Assess the regulatory landscape for a client
const landscape = await advisor.assessRegulatoryLandscape({
  clientId: 'ORG-2200',
  industry: 'financial-services',
  jurisdictions: ['US-federal', 'US-NY', 'EU'],
  focusAreas: ['data-privacy', 'anti-money-laundering', 'consumer-protection']
})

// Identify compliance gaps
const gaps = await advisor.identifyComplianceGaps({
  clientId: 'ORG-2200',
  landscapeId: landscape.id,
  currentPolicies: ['privacy-policy-v3', 'aml-procedures-v2'],
  benchmarkStandards: ['GDPR', 'BSA-AML', 'CCPA']
})

// Deliver an advisory opinion
await advisor.deliverAdvisoryOpinion({

  await notify({
    to: 'compliance-team',
    message: `Regulatory change: ${regulation} - ${changeType}, effective ${effectiveDate}`,
    priority: 'high'
  })
})

// Auto-schedule compliance review after remediation
advisor.remediationPlanDeveloped(async ({ clientId, planId, targetDate }) => {
  await scheduleTask({
    action: 'conductComplianceReview',
    clientId,
    planId,
    scheduledDate: targetDate
  })
})
```
