## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { recommendLegalActions } from '@headlessly/recommend-legal-actions'

const advisory = recommendLegalActions()

// Evaluate breach of contract situation
const situation = await advisory.evaluateSituation({
  matterId: 'matter-987',
  disputeType: 'Breach of contract',
  damages: 850000,
  contractTerms: 'Exclusive distribution agreement',
  clientGoals: ['Recover damages', 'Maintain relationship if possible']
})

// Identify available options
const options = await advisory.identifyOptions({
  situationId: situation.id,
  remedies: ['Litigation', 'Mediation', 'Arbitration', 'Negotiated settlement'],
  jurisdiction: 'Delaware'
})

// Recommend specific action
const recommendation = await advisory.recommendAction({
  situationId: situation.id,
  advisedAction: 'Mediation',
  rationale: 'Preserves business relationship while recovering substantial damages',
  alternativeConsidered: 'Litigation if mediation fails'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Generate cost-benefit analysis when recommendation made
advisory.actionRecommended(async ({ situationId, recommendation }) => {
  await generateReport({
    template: 'cost-benefit-analysis',
    data: {
      action: recommendation.advisedAction,
      costs: recommendation.estimatedCosts,
      benefits: recommendation.projectedOutcome,
      risks: recommendation.riskFactors
    },
    deliverTo: recommendation.clientId
  })
})

// Alert on high-risk recommendations
advisory.outcomesProjected(async ({ situationId, projections }) => {
  if (projections.successProbability < 50 && projections.costs > 100000) {
    await notify({
      to: 'review-committee',
      priority: 'high',
      message: `High-risk recommendation for ${situationId}: <50% success, >$100K cost`
    })
  }
})
```
