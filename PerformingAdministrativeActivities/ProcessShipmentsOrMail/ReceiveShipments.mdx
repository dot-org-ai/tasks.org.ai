## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { receiveShipments } from '@headlessly/receive-shipments'

const receiving = receiveShipments()

// Accept and inspect a delivery
const delivery = await receiving.acceptDelivery({
  carrier: 'fedex',
  trackingNumber: 'FX-789456123',
  purchaseOrderId: 'PO-2026-0412'
})

const inspection = await receiving.inspectContents({
  shipmentId: delivery.id,
  expectedItems: [
    { sku: 'PART-A100', expectedQty: 100 },
    { sku: 'PART-B200', expectedQty: 50 }
  ]
})

// Handle discrepancies and process into inventory
if (inspection.discrepancies.length > 0) {
  await receiving.documentDiscrepancies({
    shipmentId: delivery.id,
    discrepancies: inspection.discrepancies
  })
}

await receiving.createReceivingReport({ shipmentId: delivery.id })
await receiving.processIntoInventory({ shipmentId: delivery.id })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-notify purchasing when discrepancies are found
receiving.discrepanciesDocumented(async ({ shipmentId, supplierId, discrepancies }) => {
  await receiving.notifyPurchasing({
    shipmentId,
    supplierId,
    issue: `${discrepancies.length} line items with quantity or item discrepancies`
  })
})

// File insurance claim when damage exceeds threshold
receiving.damageReported(async ({ shipmentId, carrierId, damageValue }) => {
  if (damageValue > 500) {
    await fileClaim({
      carrier: carrierId,
      shipmentId,
      amount: damageValue,
      type: 'transit-damage'
    })
  }
})
```
