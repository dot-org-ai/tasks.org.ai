## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { fileDocumentsRecords } from '@headlessly/file-documents-records'

const filing = fileDocumentsRecords()

// Receive and classify an incoming document
const record = await filing.receiveDocument({
  source: 'accounts-payable',
  documentType: 'invoice',
  fileName: 'INV-2026-00412.pdf'
})

await filing.classifyRecord({
  recordId: record.id,
  category: 'financial-invoices',
  tags: ['vendor-payment', 'q1-2026']
})

// Index and store
await filing.indexRecord({ recordId: record.id })
await filing.storeRecord({
  recordId: record.id,
  location: 'cloud-archive-tier-1'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-classify based on source department
filing.documentReceived(async ({ recordId, source, documentType }) => {
  const category = await resolveCategory(source, documentType)
  await filing.classifyRecord({ recordId, category })
})

// Notify compliance when records approach expiration
filing.getExpiringRecords(async ({ records }) => {
  for (const record of records) {
    await notify({
      to: 'compliance-team',
      message: `Record ${record.id} expires on ${record.expirationDate}`
    })
  }
})
```
