const correspondence = prepareBusinessCorrespondence()

// Select a template and draft a letter
const template = await correspondence.selectTemplate({
  category: 'client-proposal',
  format: 'formal-letter'
})

const draft = await correspondence.draftCorrespondence({

    message: `Your correspondence draft ${draftId} has been approved and is ready for distribution.`,
