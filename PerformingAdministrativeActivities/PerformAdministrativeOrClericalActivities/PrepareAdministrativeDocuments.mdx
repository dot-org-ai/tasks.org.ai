## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { prepareAdministrativeDocuments } from '@headlessly/prepare-administrative-documents'

const docs = prepareAdministrativeDocuments()

// Create a new memo from template
const memo = await docs.createDocument({
  type: 'memo',
  templateId: 'internal-memo-v3',
  subject: 'Q2 Office Policy Update',
  author: 'admin-services'
})

// Draft and format the content
await docs.draftContent({
  documentId: memo.id,
  body: 'Effective June 1, all departments must submit travel requests...',
  attachments: ['travel-form-2026.pdf']
})

await docs.formatDocument({
  documentId: memo.id,
  style: 'corporate-standard'
})

// Submit for review and distribute
await docs.reviewDocument({ documentId: memo.id, reviewer: 'legal-dept' })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-distribute once approved
docs.documentApproved(async ({ documentId, approvedBy }) => {
  const doc = await docs.findDocuments({ id: documentId })
  await docs.distributeDocument({
    documentId,
    recipients: doc.distributionList
  })
})

// Archive after distribution
docs.documentDistributed(async ({ documentId }) => {
  await docs.archiveDocument({
    documentId,
    retentionPolicy: 'standard-7-year'
  })
})
```
