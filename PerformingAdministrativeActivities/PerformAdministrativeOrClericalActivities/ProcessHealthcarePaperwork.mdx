const healthcare = processHealthcarePaperwork()

// Process a new patient intake form
await healthcare.processIntakeForm({
  patientId: 'pat-90421',
  formType: 'new-patient-registration',
  data: {
    demographics: { name: 'Jane Smith', dob: '1985-03-15' },
    insuranceInfo: { provider: 'BlueCross', memberId: 'BC-445821' },

// Auto-submit claims after medical records are updated
healthcare.medicalRecordUpdated(async ({ patientId, visitId }) => {
  const pendingServices = await getPendingBillingItems({ patientId, visitId })
  if (pendingServices.length > 0) {
    await healthcare.submitClaim({
      patientId,
      services: pendingServices,
      dateOfService: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]
    })
  }
})

// Alert billing team on claim denials
healthcare.remittanceProcessed(async ({ claimId, status, reason }) => {
  if (status === 'denied') {
    await notify({
      to: 'billing-team',
      message: `Claim ${claimId} denied: ${reason}. Review for appeal.`,
      channel: 'internal'
