## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { performStudentEnrollmentRegistrationActivities } from '@headlessly/perform-student-enrollment-registration-activities'

const enrollment = performStudentEnrollmentRegistrationActivities()

// Process a new student application
const application = await enrollment.processApplication({
  studentId: 'stu-20261045',
  program: 'computer-science-bs',
  term: 'fall-2026',
  transcripts: ['external-university-transcript.pdf']
})

// Register for courses after admission
await enrollment.verifyPrerequisites({
  studentId: 'stu-20261045',
  courseId: 'CS-301'
})

const registration = await enrollment.registerForCourse({
  studentId: 'stu-20261045',
  courseId: 'CS-301',
  sectionId: 'section-02',
  term: 'fall-2026'
})

// Assess tuition and confirm
await enrollment.assessTuition({ studentId: 'stu-20261045', term: 'fall-2026' })
await enrollment.confirmEnrollment({ studentId: 'stu-20261045', term: 'fall-2026' })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Send welcome package when enrollment is confirmed
enrollment.enrollmentConfirmed(async ({ studentId, term }) => {
  await sendWelcomePackage({
    to: studentId,
    term,
    contents: ['orientation-schedule', 'campus-map', 'student-handbook']
  })
})

// Notify financial aid when tuition is assessed
enrollment.tuitionAssessed(async ({ studentId, amount, term }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'financial-aid-office',
    message: `Tuition of $${amount} assessed for student ${studentId} in ${term}`,
    channel: 'internal'
  })
})
```
