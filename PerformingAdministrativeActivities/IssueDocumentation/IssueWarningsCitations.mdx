## Overview

Issuing warnings and citations involves identifying violations or non-compliance, documenting the infraction, formally notifying the responsible party, and tracking the resolution or escalation of the matter. This definition exposes actions for each stage of the enforcement process, events for monitoring violation status changes, and searches for retrieving citation records across categories and recipients.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { issueWarningsCitations } from '@headlessly/issue-warnings-citations'

const enforcement = issueWarningsCitations()

// Document a safety violation
const violation = await enforcement.documentViolation({
  violatorId: 'contractor-2291',
  type: 'safety-violation',
  severity: 'high',
  description: 'Failure to wear required personal protective equipment',
  location: 'warehouse-b',
  observedBy: 'inspector-405'
})

// Issue a citation with corrective requirements
const citation = await enforcement.issueCitation({
  violationId: violation.id,
  penalty: { type: 'fine', amount: 2500, currency: 'USD' },
  correctiveAction: 'Complete safety training within 30 days',
  dueDate: '2026-03-07'
})

// Process an appeal if contested
await enforcement.processAppeal({
  citationId: citation.id,
  grounds: 'Equipment was provided but not yet distributed',
  evidence: ['distribution-log-feb.pdf']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Escalate repeated violations automatically
enforcement.warningIssued(async ({ violatorId, violationType }) => {
  const history = await enforcement.getViolationHistory({ violatorId })
  const repeatCount = history.filter(v => v.type === violationType).length
  if (repeatCount >= 3) {
    await enforcement.escalateViolation({
      violatorId,
      reason: `${repeatCount} repeated ${violationType} violations`
    })
  }
})

// Notify legal when a citation is appealed
enforcement.appealSubmitted(async ({ citationId, violatorId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'legal-department',
    message: `Citation ${citationId} has been appealed by ${violatorId}`,
    channel: 'email'
  })
})
```
