# Issue Documentation Identification Customers Employees

> Business-as-Code definition for issuing documentation and identification to customers or employees. Models the credential provisioning lifecycle from identity verification through document creation, distribution, and replacement.

## Overview

Issuing documentation and identification to customers or employees involves verifying identity, creating official credentials such as badges, ID cards, or membership documents, and managing their lifecycle including replacements and deactivations. This definition exposes actions for each step of the identification issuance process, events for tracking credential status, and searches for retrieving documentation records across holders and document types.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { issueDocumentationIdentificationCustomersEmployees } from '@headlessly/issue-documentation-identification-customers-employees'

const docs = issueDocumentationIdentificationCustomersEmployees()

// Verify identity and issue an employee badge
await docs.verifyIdentity({
  personId: 'emp-4410',
  method: 'government-id',
  documentNumber: 'DL-9823741'
})

const badge = await docs.createDocument({
  holderId: 'emp-4410',
  type: 'employee-badge',
  template: 'corporate-standard',
  accessProfile: { building: 'HQ', floors: [1, 2, 3], parking: true }
})

await docs.issueDocument({
  documentId: badge.id,
  deliveryMethod: 'in-person',
  location: 'reception-desk'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Deactivate old credentials when a replacement is issued
docs.documentReplaced(async ({ oldDocumentId, newDocumentId }) => {
  await docs.deactivateDocument({ documentId: oldDocumentId })
  await notify({
    to: 'security-team',
    message: `Document ${oldDocumentId} has been replaced by ${newDocumentId}`
  })
})

// Alert security when a document is deactivated
docs.documentDeactivated(async ({ documentId, holderId }) => {
  await updateAccessControl({
    holderId,
    action: 'revoke',
    documentId
  })
})
```
