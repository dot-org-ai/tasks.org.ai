## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { issuePermitsLegalDocuments } from '@headlessly/issue-permits-legal-documents'

const permits = issuePermitsLegalDocuments()

// Submit a building permit application
const application = await permits.submitApplication({
  applicantId: 'org-2045',
  type: 'building-permit',
  jurisdiction: 'county-harris',
  details: { address: '1200 Main St', projectType: 'commercial-renovation' }
})

// Verify eligibility
await permits.verifyEligibility({ applicationId: application.id })

// Approve and generate the document
await permits.approveApplication({ applicationId: application.id })
const document = await permits.generateDocument({
  applicationId: application.id,
  format: 'pdf',
  expirationDate: '2027-02-01'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify applicant when application is approved
permits.applicationApproved(async ({ applicationId, applicantId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: applicantId,
    message: `Your permit application ${applicationId} has been approved.`,
    channel: 'email'
  })
})

// Schedule inspection when compliance review is completed
permits.complianceReviewCompleted(async ({ applicationId, result }) => {
  if (result === 'conditional') {
    await scheduleInspection({
      applicationId,
      type: 'site-visit',
      priority: 'standard'
    })
  }
})
```
