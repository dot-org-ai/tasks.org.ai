# Issue Certificates Licenses

> Business-as-Code definition for issuing certificates and licenses. Models the credential issuance lifecycle from application and verification through approval, generation, and renewal.

## Overview

Issuing certificates and licenses involves evaluating applicant qualifications, verifying compliance with standards or training requirements, and producing official credentials. This definition exposes actions for managing the full credential lifecycle including issuance, renewal, and revocation, events for tracking status transitions, and searches for retrieving credential records across categories and holders.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { issueCertificatesLicenses } from '@headlessly/issue-certificates-licenses'

const credentials = issueCertificatesLicenses()

// Submit a professional license application
const application = await credentials.submitApplication({
  applicantId: 'person-7823',
  type: 'professional-license',
  category: 'real-estate-broker',
  qualifications: { examScore: 92, hoursCompleted: 180 }
})

// Verify and approve
await credentials.verifyQualifications({ applicationId: application.id })
await credentials.conductBackgroundCheck({ applicationId: application.id })
await credentials.approveCertification({ applicationId: application.id })

// Generate the license document
const license = await credentials.generateCertificate({
  applicationId: application.id,
  validFrom: '2026-03-01',
  validUntil: '2028-03-01'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify holder when credential is approaching expiration
credentials.certificateGenerated(async ({ credentialId, holderId, validUntil }) => {
  await scheduleReminder({
    credentialId,
    recipientId: holderId,
    triggerDate: subtractDays(validUntil, 90),
    message: 'Your credential expires in 90 days. Please begin the renewal process.'
  })
})

// Auto-initiate renewal workflow
credentials.credentialRenewed(async ({ credentialId, holderId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: holderId,
    message: `Your credential ${credentialId} has been renewed successfully.`,
    channel: 'email'
  })
})
```
