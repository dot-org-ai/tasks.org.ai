## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { arrangeInsuranceCoverage } from '@headlessly/arrange-insurance-coverage'

const insurance = arrangeInsuranceCoverage()

// Assess coverage needs
const assessment = await insurance.assessCoverageNeeds({
  entityId: 'org-3291',
  coverageTypes: ['general-liability', 'property', 'workers-compensation'],
  assetValue: 5000000
})

// Request and evaluate quotes
await insurance.requestQuotes({
  requestId: assessment.requestId,
  carriers: ['carrier-a', 'carrier-b', 'carrier-c']
})

const comparison = await insurance.evaluateQuotes({ requestId: assessment.requestId })

// Bind selected coverage
const policy = await insurance.bindCoverage({
  quoteId: comparison.recommended.quoteId,
  effectiveDate: '2026-03-01'
})

await insurance.issueCertificate({ policyId: policy.id })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-initiate renewal process before expiration
insurance.coverageBound(async ({ policyId, expirationDate }) => {
  const renewalDate = subtractDays(expirationDate, 60)
  await scheduleAt(renewalDate, async () => {
    await insurance.requestQuotes({ policyId, renewal: true })
  })
})

// Notify compliance when coverage terms change
insurance.policyEndorsed(async ({ policyId, endorsementId, changes }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'compliance-team',
    message: `Policy ${policyId} endorsed: ${changes.summary}`
  })
})
```
