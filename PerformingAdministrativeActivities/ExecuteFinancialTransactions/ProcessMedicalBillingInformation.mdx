## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { processMedicalBillingInformation } from '@headlessly/process-medical-billing-information'

const billing = processMedicalBillingInformation()

// Code services from a patient encounter
await billing.codeMedicalServices({
  encounterId: 'enc-44210',
  codes: [
    { type: 'CPT', code: '99213', description: 'Office visit, established patient' },
    { type: 'ICD-10', code: 'J06.9', description: 'Acute upper respiratory infection' }
  ]
})

// Submit the claim
const claim = await billing.submitClaim({
  patientId: 'pat-11820',
  encounterId: 'enc-44210',
  carrierId: 'aetna',
  totalCharge: 185.00
})

// Track and post payment
const result = await billing.trackAdjudication({ claimId: claim.id })
await billing.postPayment({
  claimId: claim.id,
  paidAmount: result.allowedAmount,
  adjustments: result.adjustments
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-generate patient statement when balance remains
billing.paymentPosted(async ({ patientId, claimId, remainingBalance }) => {
  if (remainingBalance > 0) {
    await billing.generatePatientStatement({
      patientId,
      balance: remainingBalance
    })
  }
})

// Auto-investigate denied claims
billing.claimDenied(async ({ claimId, denialReason }) => {
  await billing.investigateDenial({ claimId, reason: denialReason })
})
```
