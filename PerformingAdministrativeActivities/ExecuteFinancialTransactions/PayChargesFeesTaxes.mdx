// Identify and calculate a quarterly tax obligation
const obligation = await payments.identifyObligation({
  type: 'sales-tax',
  jurisdiction: 'CA',
  period: 'Q1-2026'
})

const amount = await payments.calculateAmountDue({

// Schedule and authorize
await payments.schedulePayment({
  obligationId: obligation.id,

    amount
  })
})

// Alert on overdue obligations
payments.getOverdueObligations(async ({ obligations }) => {
  for (const ob of obligations) {

      to: 'accounts-payable',
      message: `Overdue: ${ob.type} of $${ob.amount} was due ${ob.dueDate}`
