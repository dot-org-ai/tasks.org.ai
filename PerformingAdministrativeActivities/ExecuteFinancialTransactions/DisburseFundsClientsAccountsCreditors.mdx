## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { disburseFundsClientsAccountsCreditors } from '@headlessly/disburse-funds-clients-accounts-creditors'

const disbursements = disburseFundsClientsAccountsCreditors()

// Create a disbursement request
const request = await disbursements.createDisbursementRequest({
  clientId: 'client-7742',
  creditorId: 'creditor-1190',
  amount: 15000.00,
  currency: 'USD',
  paymentMethod: 'wire-transfer',
  reference: 'INV-2026-0088'
})

// Verify and authorize
await disbursements.verifyAccountBalance({ clientId: 'client-7742' })
await disbursements.obtainAuthorization({ requestId: request.id })

// Execute the transfer
await disbursements.executeDisbursement({ requestId: request.id })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-record and reconcile upon execution
disbursements.disbursementExecuted(async ({ requestId, amount, creditorId }) => {
  await disbursements.recordDisbursement({ requestId })
  await disbursements.reconcileDisbursement({
    requestId,
    matchTo: 'invoice'
  })
})

// Alert on insufficient funds
disbursements.balanceVerified(async ({ clientId, available, required }) => {
  if (available < required) {
    await notify({
      to: clientId,
      message: `Insufficient funds: $${available} available, $${required} required for pending disbursement.`
    })
  }
})
```
