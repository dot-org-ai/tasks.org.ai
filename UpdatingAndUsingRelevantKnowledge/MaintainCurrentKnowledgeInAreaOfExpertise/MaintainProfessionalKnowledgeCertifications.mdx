### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainProfessionalKnowledgeCertifications } from '@headlessly/maintain-professional-knowledge-certifications'

const certs = maintainProfessionalKnowledgeCertifications()

// Track all certifications for a professional
const certList = await certs.trackCertifications({
  professionalId: 'EMP-3321',
  includeExpired: false
})

// Log completion of a CEU course
await certs.completeCEU({
  professionalId: 'EMP-3321',
  courseId: 'AMA-PRA-2026-045',
  credits: 12,
  category: 'Category-1',
  completionDate: '2026-02-01'
})

// Submit renewal application
await certs.submitRenewal({
  certificationId: 'BOARD-CERT-IM-2023',
  professionalId: 'EMP-3321',
  ceuTranscriptId: 'TR-2026-3321',
  renewalFee: 450
})
```

// Send reminder when renewal deadline approaches
certs.renewalDeadlineApproaching(async ({ certificationId, professionalId, daysRemaining }) => {
  await notify({
    to: professionalId,
    message: `Certification ${certificationId} expires in ${daysRemaining} days - complete renewal now`
  })
})

// Escalate lapsed certifications to compliance
certs.certificationLapsed(async ({ certificationId, professionalId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'compliance-office',
    message: `Certification ${certificationId} for ${professionalId} has lapsed - immediate action required`
  })
  await restrictPracticePrivileges({ professionalId, reason: 'lapsed-certification' })
