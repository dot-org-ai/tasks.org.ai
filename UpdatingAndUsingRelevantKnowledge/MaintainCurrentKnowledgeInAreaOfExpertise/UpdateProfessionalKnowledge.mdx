## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { updateProfessionalKnowledge } from '@headlessly/update-professional-knowledge'

const knowledge = updateProfessionalKnowledge()

// Assess current knowledge gaps
const gaps = await knowledge.assessKnowledgeGaps({
  professionalId: 'EMP-4421',
  domains: ['data-analytics', 'machine-learning', 'cloud-architecture'],
  benchmarkAgainst: 'role-requirements'
})

// Create a learning plan to address gaps
const plan = await knowledge.createLearningPlan({
  professionalId: 'EMP-4421',
  gaps: gaps.prioritized,
  timeline: { start: '2026-02-01', end: '2026-06-30' },
  budget: 5000
})

// Record course completion
await knowledge.completeCourse({
  professionalId: 'EMP-4421',
  courseId: 'ML-201',
  provider: 'Coursera',
  completionDate: '2026-03-15',
  score: 94
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Prompt knowledge sharing after course completion
knowledge.courseCompleted(async ({ professionalId, courseId, topic }) => {
  await scheduleKnowledgeSession({
    presenter: professionalId,
    topic: `Key learnings from ${topic}`,
    audience: 'team',
    suggestedDate: nextFriday()
  })
})

// Auto-refresh learning plans when new gaps are identified
knowledge.knowledgeGapIdentified(async ({ professionalId, gap, severity }) => {
  if (severity === 'critical') {
    await knowledge.createLearningPlan({
      professionalId,
      gaps: [gap],
      timeline: { start: today(), end: inWeeks(4) },
      priority: 'urgent'
    })
  }
})
```
