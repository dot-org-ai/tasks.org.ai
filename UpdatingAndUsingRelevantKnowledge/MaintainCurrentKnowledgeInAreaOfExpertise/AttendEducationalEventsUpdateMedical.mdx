## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { attendEducationalEventsUpdateMedical } from '@headlessly/attend-educational-events-update-medical'

const medicalEd = attendEducationalEventsUpdateMedical()

// Check licensure compliance
const status = await medicalEd.trackLicensureCompliance({
  clinicianId: 'dr-4521',
  renewalDate: '2027-06-30',
  requiredCredits: 50
})

// Find and enroll in a CME program
const programs = await medicalEd.identifyCMEOpportunity({
  specialty: 'cardiology',
  creditType: 'AMA-PRA-Category-1',
  format: 'live-conference'
})

await medicalEd.enrollInProgram({
  programId: programs[0].id,
  clinicianId: 'dr-4521'
})

// Earn credits and update practice
await medicalEd.earnCMECredits({
  programId: programs[0].id,
  clinicianId: 'dr-4521',
  creditsEarned: 12
})

await medicalEd.updateClinicalPractice({
  clinicianId: 'dr-4521',
  guidelineId: 'gl-heart-failure-2026',
  changes: ['updated-medication-protocol', 'revised-monitoring-schedule']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert clinicians approaching licensure deadline
medicalEd.licensureComplianceTracked(async ({ clinicianId, creditsRemaining, renewalDate }) => {
  const monthsLeft = monthsUntil(renewalDate)
  if (creditsRemaining > 0 && monthsLeft <= 6) {
    await notify({
      to: clinicianId,
      message: `${creditsRemaining} CME credits needed before ${renewalDate}`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-review guidelines after earning credits
medicalEd.cmeCreditsEarned(async ({ programId, specialty }) => {
  const guidelines = await medicalEd.getClinicalGuidelines({ specialty })
  for (const guideline of guidelines) {
    await medicalEd.reviewClinicalGuideline({ guidelineId: guideline.id })
  }
})
```
