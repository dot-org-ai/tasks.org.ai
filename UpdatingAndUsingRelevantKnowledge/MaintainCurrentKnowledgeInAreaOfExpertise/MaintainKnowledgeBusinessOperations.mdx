## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainKnowledgeBusinessOperations } from '@headlessly/maintain-knowledge-business-operations'

const operations = maintainKnowledgeBusinessOperations()

// Track new market intelligence
const intel = await operations.trackMarketIntelligence({
  source: 'Q1 Industry Report',
  topics: ['supply-chain', 'digital-transformation'],
  relevance: 'high'
})

// Analyze benchmark against industry standards
const benchmark = await operations.analyzeBenchmark({
  metric: 'order-fulfillment-time',
  internalValue: 2.3,
  industryAverage: 1.8,
  unit: 'days'
})

// Document a process change
await operations.documentProcessChange({
  processId: 'proc-inventory-mgmt',
  changeDescription: 'Implemented automated reorder triggers',
  effectiveDate: '2026-04-01'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert when benchmarks reveal performance gaps
operations.benchmarkAnalyzed(async ({ metric, gap }) => {
  if (gap.percentage > 20) {
    await notify({
      to: 'operations-leadership',
      message: `Significant gap in ${metric}: ${gap.percentage}% below industry average`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-distribute when insights are synthesized
operations.insightsSynthesized(async ({ summary, topics }) => {
  await operations.distributeKnowledge({
    content: summary,
    audience: topics.map(t => `${t}-stakeholders`)
  })
})
```
