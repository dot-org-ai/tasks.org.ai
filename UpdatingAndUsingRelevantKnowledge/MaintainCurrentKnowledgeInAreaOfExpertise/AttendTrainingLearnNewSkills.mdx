## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { attendTrainingLearnNewSkills } from '@headlessly/attend-training-learn-new-skills'

const training = attendTrainingLearnNewSkills()

// Identify skill gaps for an employee
const gaps = await training.identifySkillGap({
  employeeId: 'emp-4421',
  roleRequirements: ['data-analysis', 'python', 'cloud-infrastructure'],
  currentSkills: ['data-analysis', 'sql']
})

// Enroll in a training program
const enrollment = await training.enrollInTraining({
  learnerId: 'emp-4421',
  programId: 'prog-python-advanced',
  startDate: '2026-03-01',
  format: 'online-self-paced'
})

// Track training progress
const progress = await training.trackProgress({
  learnerId: 'emp-4421',
  programId: 'prog-python-advanced'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify manager when training is completed
training.trainingCompleted(async ({ learnerId, programId, completionDate }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'manager',
    message: `Employee ${learnerId} completed ${programId} on ${completionDate}`
  })
})

// Auto-update learning plan when a skill gap is identified
training.skillGapIdentified(async ({ employeeId, gaps }) => {
  const programs = await training.findTrainingPrograms({
    skills: gaps.map(g => g.skill),
    format: 'online'
  })
  await training.updateLearningPlan({
    employeeId,
    recommendedPrograms: programs.map(p => p.id)
  })
})
```
