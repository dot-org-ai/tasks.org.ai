## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { stayInformedAboutCurrentDevelopments } from '@headlessly/stay-informed-about-current-developments'

const developments = stayInformedAboutCurrentDevelopments()

// Subscribe to a new industry source
const subscription = await developments.subscribeToSource({
  name: 'Journal of Applied Data Science',
  type: 'academic-journal',
  topics: ['machine-learning', 'data-engineering'],
  frequency: 'weekly'
})

// Review and curate a development
const finding = await developments.reviewDevelopment({
  sourceId: subscription.id,
  developmentId: 'dev-2026-0412',
  relevanceScore: 0.85
})

await developments.curateFinding({
  developmentId: finding.id,
  tags: ['neural-networks', 'optimization'],
  priority: 'high'
})

// Generate a trend report
const report = await developments.generateTrendReport({
  period: { start: '2026-01-01', end: '2026-03-31' },
  topics: ['machine-learning']
})
```
