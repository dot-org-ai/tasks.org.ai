## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainCurrentKnowledgeRelatedWork } from '@headlessly/maintain-current-knowledge-related-work'

const workKnowledge = maintainCurrentKnowledgeRelatedWork()

// Identify knowledge gaps for a role
const gaps = await workKnowledge.identifyKnowledgeGap({
  roleId: 'production-operator',
  lastAssessment: '2025-12-01',
  threshold: 0.8
})

// Review a procedure update
await workKnowledge.reviewProcedureUpdate({
  procedureId: 'proc-safety-lockout',
  version: '3.2',
  changeType: 'regulatory-update'
})

// Complete a refresher module
await workKnowledge.completeRefresher({
  moduleId: 'mod-lockout-tagout-2026',
  employeeId: 'emp-3021',
  score: 0.92
})

// Update the competency record
await workKnowledge.updateCompetencyRecord({
  employeeId: 'emp-3021',
  skill: 'lockout-tagout-procedure',
  level: 'proficient',
  validUntil: '2027-03-01'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-assign refreshers when knowledge gaps are found
workKnowledge.knowledgeGapIdentified(async ({ employeeId, skill, severity }) => {
  const module = await workKnowledge.findRefresherModules({
    topic: skill,
    difficulty: severity
  })
  await assignTraining({ employeeId, moduleId: module[0].id })
})

// Notify supervisors of policy acknowledgments
workKnowledge.policyChangeAcknowledged(async ({ employeeId, policyId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'supervisor',
    message: `Employee ${employeeId} acknowledged policy ${policyId}`
  })
})
```
