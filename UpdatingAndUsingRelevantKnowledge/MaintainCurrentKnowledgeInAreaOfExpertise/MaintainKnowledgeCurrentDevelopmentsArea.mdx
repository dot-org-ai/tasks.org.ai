## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainKnowledgeCurrentDevelopmentsArea } from '@headlessly/maintain-knowledge-current-developments-area'

const developments = maintainKnowledgeCurrentDevelopmentsArea()

// Monitor developments in the field
const feed = await developments.monitorDevelopments({
  domains: ['structural-engineering', 'seismic-design', 'composite-materials'],
  sources: ['ASCE-Journal', 'Engineering-News-Record', 'arXiv-CE'],
  since: '2026-01-01'
})

// Evaluate relevance of a specific development
const evaluation = await developments.evaluateRelevance({
  developmentId: feed.items[0].id,
  practiceContext: 'commercial-building-design',
  criteria: ['applicability', 'evidenceStrength', 'implementationEase']
})

// Synthesize and publish a digest
await developments.publishDigest({
  title: 'January 2026 Structural Engineering Developments',
  developments: feed.items.filter(d => d.relevanceScore >= 7),
  audience: ['engineering-team', 'project-managers']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Flag major advances for immediate team attention
developments.significantAdvanceDetected(async ({ development, impactLevel, domain }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'department-leads',
    message: `Significant advance in ${domain}: ${development.title} - impact: ${impactLevel}`
  })
})

// Auto-update expertise profiles when best practices are integrated
developments.bestPracticesIntegrated(async ({ practiceId, domain, professionalId }) => {
  await updateExpertiseProfile({
    professionalId,
    domain,
    addedCapability: practiceId,
    updatedDate: today()
  })
})
```
