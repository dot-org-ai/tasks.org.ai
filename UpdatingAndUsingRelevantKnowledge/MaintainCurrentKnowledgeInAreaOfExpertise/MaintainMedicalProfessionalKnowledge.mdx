## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { maintainMedicalProfessionalKnowledge } from '@headlessly/maintain-medical-professional-knowledge'

const medKnowledge = maintainMedicalProfessionalKnowledge()

// Review recent literature in a specialty area
const articles = await medKnowledge.reviewLiterature({
  specialty: 'cardiology',
  topics: ['heart-failure-management', 'anticoagulation-therapy'],
  dateRange: { start: '2025-10-01', end: '2026-02-01' }
})

// Complete a CME activity and log credits
const completion = await medKnowledge.completeCME({
  clinicianId: 'dr-8891',
  courseId: 'cme-cardio-2026-advanced-hf',
  completionDate: '2026-02-04',
  creditsEarned: 12
})

// Check renewal status
const renewal = await medKnowledge.getRenewalStatus({
  clinicianId: 'dr-8891',
  licenseType: 'medical-license-CA'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert clinician when licensure renewal deadline approaches
medKnowledge.renewalDeadlineApproaching(async ({ clinicianId, licenseType, deadline }) => {
  await notify({
    to: clinicianId,
    message: `Your ${licenseType} renewal is due by ${deadline}. You have ${creditsRemaining} CME credits outstanding.`
  })
})

// Auto-flag protocols for review when clinical alerts arrive
medKnowledge.clinicalAlertReceived(async ({ alertType, condition, guideline }) => {
  await createTask({
    assignee: 'chief-medical-officer',
    title: `Review protocol for ${condition} - new ${alertType}`,
    reference: guideline
  })
})
```
