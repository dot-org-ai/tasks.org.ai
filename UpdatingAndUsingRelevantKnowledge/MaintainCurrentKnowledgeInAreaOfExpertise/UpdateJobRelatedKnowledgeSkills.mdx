## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { updateJobRelatedKnowledgeSkills } from '@headlessly/update-job-related-knowledge-skills'

const skills = updateJobRelatedKnowledgeSkills()

// Assess current skills against role requirements
const assessment = await skills.assessCurrentSkills({
  employeeId: 'emp-3307',
  roleId: 'senior-data-engineer',
  competencies: ['apache-spark', 'dbt', 'data-modeling', 'cloud-architecture']
})

// Set development goals based on assessment
await skills.setDevelopmentGoals({
  employeeId: 'emp-3307',
  goals: [
    { skill: 'dbt', targetLevel: 'advanced', deadline: '2026-06-30' },
    { skill: 'cloud-architecture', targetLevel: 'intermediate', deadline: '2026-09-30' }
  ]
})

// Complete a learning activity
await skills.completeLearningActivity({
  employeeId: 'emp-3307',
  activityType: 'online-course',
  title: 'Advanced dbt for Analytics Engineering',
  hoursSpent: 16,
  completionDate: '2026-03-15'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify supervisor when competency is validated
skills.competencyValidated(async ({ employeeId, skill, level }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'supervisor',
    message: `${employeeId} has achieved ${level} proficiency in ${skill}`
  })
})

// Auto-recommend resources when new development goals are set
skills.developmentGoalsSet(async ({ employeeId, goals }) => {
  for (const goal of goals) {
    const resources = await skills.findLearningResources({
      skill: goal.skill,
      targetLevel: goal.targetLevel,
      format: 'online'
    })
    await notify({
      to: employeeId,
      message: `Recommended resources for ${goal.skill}: ${resources.map(r => r.title).join(', ')}`
    })
  }
})
```
