## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { examineConditionPropertyProducts } from '@headlessly/examine-condition-property-products'

const examination = examineConditionPropertyProducts()

// Schedule a property condition examination
const exam = await examination.scheduleExamination({
  subjectType: 'residential-property',
  address: '1240 Maple Drive, Portland, OR 97201',
  requestedBy: 'lender-pacific-mortgage',
  purpose: 'pre-purchase-inspection',
  preferredDate: '2026-03-15'
})

// Conduct and document examination
await examination.conductExamination({
  examinationId: exam.id,
  checkpoints: ['foundation', 'roofing', 'plumbing', 'electrical', 'HVAC', 'interior', 'exterior'],
  weatherConditions: 'clear-dry'
})

// Document a specific deficiency
await examination.documentDeficiency({
  examinationId: exam.id,
  area: 'roofing',
  description: 'Missing shingles on south-facing slope, approximately 15 sq ft affected',
  severity: 'moderate',
  recommendation: 'Replace damaged section before next rain season'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-generate report when all checkpoints are examined
examination.examinationCompleted(async ({ examinationId, subjectId }) => {
  const deficiencies = await examination.getDeficiencies({ examinationId })
  const hasRepairs = deficiencies.some(d => d.severity !== 'cosmetic')
  if (hasRepairs) {
    await examination.estimateRepairCost({ examinationId })
  }
  await examination.generateReport({ examinationId })
})

// Notify requesting party when report is ready
examination.reportGenerated(async ({ examinationId, reportId, requestedBy }) => {
  await notify({
    to: requestedBy,
    message: `Condition report ${reportId} for examination ${examinationId} is now available`
  })
})
```
