# Inspect Vehicles to Determine Overall Condition

> Business-as-Code definition for inspecting vehicles to determine overall condition. Models the comprehensive vehicle assessment workflow of evaluating mechanical, cosmetic, and functional condition to produce an accurate condition rating for resale, lease return, insurance, or fleet management purposes.

## Overview

Inspecting vehicles to determine overall condition involves conducting multi-point assessments that evaluate the mechanical soundness, cosmetic appearance, interior condition, electronic functionality, and documentation completeness of automobiles, trucks, and specialty vehicles. This definition covers pre-purchase inspections, lease-end evaluations, fleet disposition assessments, auction grading, and insurance appraisals. It supports used vehicle dealers, leasing companies, rental car operators, fleet management organizations, and independent appraisal services.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { inspectVehiclesDetermineOverallCondition } from '@headlessly/inspect-vehicles-determine-overall-condition'

const conditionInspection = inspectVehiclesDetermineOverallCondition()

// Initiate a lease-end assessment
const assessment = await conditionInspection.initiateAssessment({
  vin: '5YJSA1DN5DFP12345',
  year: 2023,
  make: 'Tesla',
  model: 'Model S',
  mileage: 36420,
  purpose: 'lease-return',
  leasingCompany: 'US-Bank-Leasing'
})

// Perform multi-point assessment
await conditionInspection.assessExterior({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  panels: { hood: 'good', fenderFL: 'scratch-6in', doorFL: 'good', doorRL: 'dent-2in' },
  glass: 'good',
  tires: { treadFL: 5.2, treadFR: 5.0, treadRL: 6.1, treadRR: 6.0 }
})

await conditionInspection.assessInterior({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  seats: 'normal-wear',
  carpet: 'good',
  dashboard: 'good',
  headliner: 'good'
})

await conditionInspection.assessMechanical({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  engine: 'normal-operation',
  brakes: 'adequate',
  suspension: 'no-issues'
})

// Document damage and generate report
await conditionInspection.documentDamage({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  items: [
    { location: 'front-left-fender', type: 'scratch', length: 6, unit: 'inches' },
    { location: 'rear-left-door', type: 'dent', diameter: 2, unit: 'inches' }
  ]
})

await conditionInspection.assignConditionGrade({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  scale: 'NAAA',
  grade: 3.5
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Calculate excess wear charges on lease-end assessments
conditionInspection.conditionReportGenerated(async ({ assessmentId, purpose, damageItems }) => {
  if (purpose === 'lease-return') {
    const charges = damageItems
      .filter(d => d.exceedsNormalWear)
      .map(d => ({ description: d.description, charge: d.repairCost }))
    if (charges.length > 0) {
      await leasing.issueWearCharges({ assessmentId, charges })
    }
  }
})

// Flag low-grade fleet vehicles for disposition
conditionInspection.conditionGradeAssigned(async ({ vin, grade, purpose }) => {
  if (purpose === 'fleet-evaluation' && grade < 2.5) {
    await fleet.recommendDisposition({
      vin,
      recommendation: 'wholesale-auction',
      reason: `Condition grade ${grade} below redeployment threshold`
    })
  }
})
```
