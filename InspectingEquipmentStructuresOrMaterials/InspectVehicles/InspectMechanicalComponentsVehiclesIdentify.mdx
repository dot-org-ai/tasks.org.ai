# Inspect Mechanical Components of Vehicles to Identify Problems

> Business-as-Code definition for inspecting mechanical components of vehicles to identify problems. Models the diagnostic inspection workflow of examining engine, transmission, drivetrain, braking, and suspension systems to detect wear, damage, or malfunction before failure occurs.

## Overview

Inspecting mechanical components of vehicles to identify problems involves conducting detailed examinations of engines, transmissions, differentials, braking systems, suspension assemblies, steering mechanisms, and drivetrain components to detect wear patterns, fluid leaks, unusual noises, and incipient failures. This definition covers visual inspection, measurement-based evaluation, diagnostic scanning, road testing, and repair recommendation generation. It supports automotive service shops, heavy equipment maintenance, commercial fleet diagnostics, and warranty claim investigation.

## Actors

| Actor | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| VehicleOwner | Reports symptoms and authorizes diagnostic inspections |
| WarrantyAdministrator | Reviews mechanical findings to determine warranty coverage eligibility |
| PartsDistributor | Supplies replacement components based on inspection findings |
| FleetMaintenanceManager | Prioritizes mechanical inspections across a vehicle fleet |
| VehicleManufacturer | Provides technical service bulletins and diagnostic procedures |
| InsuranceAdjuster | Evaluates mechanical damage for accident or mechanical breakdown claims |

## Roles

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { inspectMechanicalComponentsVehiclesIdentify } from '@headlessly/inspect-mechanical-components-vehicles-identify'

const mechInspection = inspectMechanicalComponentsVehiclesIdentify()

// Review customer symptoms
const symptoms = await mechInspection.reviewSymptoms({
  vehicleVin: '2T1BU4EE9DC123456',
  complaints: ['grinding-noise-braking', 'vibration-at-highway-speed'],
  mileage: 78500
})

// Scan diagnostics and inspect systems
const codes = await mechInspection.scanDiagnostics({
  vehicleVin: '2T1BU4EE9DC123456',
  modules: ['ECM', 'TCM', 'ABS', 'SRS']
})

const brakes = await mechInspection.inspectBrakes({
  vehicleVin: '2T1BU4EE9DC123456',
  checks: ['pad-thickness', 'rotor-condition', 'caliper-operation', 'brake-lines']
})

await mechInspection.measureWear({
  vehicleVin: '2T1BU4EE9DC123456',
  measurements: [
    { component: 'front-brake-pad-left', value: 2.1, unit: 'mm', minSpec: 3.0 },
    { component: 'front-brake-pad-right', value: 2.3, unit: 'mm', minSpec: 3.0 },
    { component: 'front-rotor-left', value: 24.8, unit: 'mm', minSpec: 25.0 }
  ]
})

// Generate repair plan
await mechInspection.generateRepairPlan({
  vehicleVin: '2T1BU4EE9DC123456',
  findings: [brakes],
  priority: 'safety-critical'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert fleet manager when safety-critical issues are found
mechInspection.repairPlanGenerated(async ({ vehicleVin, findings, priority }) => {
  if (priority === 'safety-critical') {
    await fleet.groundVehicle({
      vin: vehicleVin,
      reason: 'Safety-critical mechanical issue detected'
    })
    await notify({
      to: 'fleet-maintenance',
      message: `Vehicle ${vehicleVin} grounded: ${findings.length} safety issues found`
    })
  }
})

// Check for applicable service bulletins on diagnostic code retrieval
mechInspection.diagnosticsScanned(async ({ vehicleVin, codes }) => {
  for (const code of codes) {
    const bulletins = await mechInspection.getServiceBulletins({
      vehicleVin,
      relatedCode: code.id
    })
    if (bulletins.length > 0) {
      await notify({
        to: 'service-advisor',
        message: `TSB available for ${code.id} on ${vehicleVin}: ${bulletins[0].title}`
      })
    }
  }
})
