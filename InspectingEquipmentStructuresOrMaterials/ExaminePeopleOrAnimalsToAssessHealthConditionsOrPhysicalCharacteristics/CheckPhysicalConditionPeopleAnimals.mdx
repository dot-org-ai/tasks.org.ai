# Check Physical Condition People Animals

> Business-as-Code definition for physical condition assessment of people and animals. Models systematic evaluation of physical status, vital signs, mobility, and overall health indicators in healthcare, veterinary, athletic, and safety contexts.

## Overview

Physical condition checking involves systematic observation, measurement, and documentation of physical attributes and health indicators. This work spans medical examinations, veterinary assessments, athletic physicals, workplace fitness evaluations, and safety screenings. This definition exposes actions for assessment, measurement, documentation, and follow-up recommendations.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { checkPhysicalConditionPeopleAnimals } from '@headlessly/check-physical-condition-people-animals'

const exams = checkPhysicalConditionPeopleAnimals()

// Schedule pre-employment physical
const exam = await exams.scheduleExamination({
  subjectId: 'EMP-8471',
  type: 'pre-employment',
  date: '2026-03-15',
  examiner: 'dr-johnson'
})

// Measure vital signs
await exams.measureVitals({
  examinationId: exam.id,
  temperature: 98.6,
  pulse: 72,
  respiration: 16,
  bloodPressure: { systolic: 120, diastolic: 80 }
})

// Assess mobility and coordination
await exams.assessMobility({
  examinationId: exam.id,
  rangeOfMotion: 'normal',
  gait: 'steady',
  coordination: 'good',
  balance: 'stable'
})

// Perform systems review
await exams.performSystemsReview({
  examinationId: exam.id,
  cardiovascular: 'normal',
  respiratory: 'clear',
  neurological: 'intact',
  musculoskeletal: 'no limitations'
})

// Make recommendations
await exams.makeRecommendations({
  examinationId: exam.id,
  clearance: 'approved',
  restrictions: 'none',
  followUp: 'annual-physical'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Trigger additional testing when vitals are abnormal
exams.vitalsMeasured(async ({ examinationId, bloodPressure, pulse }) => {
  if (bloodPressure.systolic > 140 || pulse > 100) {
    await orderAdditionalTests({
      examinationId,
      tests: ['ecg', 'blood-panel']
    })
  }
})

// Notify occupational health when clearance is issued
exams.recommendationsMade(async ({ examinationId, subjectId, clearance }) => {
  if (clearance === 'approved') {
    await notify({
      to: 'occupational-health',
      message: `Subject ${subjectId} cleared for work`,
      examinationId
    })
  }
})
```
