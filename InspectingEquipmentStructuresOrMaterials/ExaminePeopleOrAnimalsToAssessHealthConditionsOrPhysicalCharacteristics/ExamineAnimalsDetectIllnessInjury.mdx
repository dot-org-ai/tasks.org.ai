## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { examineAnimalsDetectIllnessInjury } from '@headlessly/examine-animals-detect-illness-injury'

const vetExam = examineAnimalsDetectIllnessInjury()

// Conduct examination on dog with lethargy
const exam = await vetExam.conductExamination({
  animalId: 'DOG-4821',
  ownerId: 'OWNER-2847',
  chiefComplaint: 'lethargy-decreased-appetite',
  species: 'canine',
  breed: 'labrador-retriever',
  age: 7
})

// Measure vital signs
await vetExam.measureVitals({
  examinationId: exam.id,
  temperature: 103.2,
  heartRate: 110,
  respiratoryRate: 32,
  weight: 72
})

// Observe behavior and mental status
await vetExam.observeBehavior({
  examinationId: exam.id,
  alertness: 'dull',
  appetite: 'decreased',
  gait: 'stiff',
  demeanor: 'depressed'
})

// Palpate for abnormalities
await vetExam.palpateBody({
  examinationId: exam.id,
  abdomen: 'tense-painful',
  lymphNodes: 'normal',
  joints: 'mild-crepitus',
  skin: 'unremarkable'
})

// Order diagnostic tests
await vetExam.orderDiagnostics({
  examinationId: exam.id,
  tests: ['cbc', 'chemistry-panel', 'abdominal-radiographs']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-flag abnormal vital signs for veterinarian attention
vetExam.vitalsMeasured(async ({ examinationId, temperature, heartRate }) => {
  if (temperature > 103 || heartRate > 120) {
    await notify({
      to: 'attending-veterinarian',
      priority: 'high',
      message: `Abnormal vitals on exam ${examinationId}: Temp ${temperature}F, HR ${heartRate}`,
      requiresReview: true
    })
  }
})

// Trigger treatment plan notification when diagnosis is complete
vetExam.treatmentPlanDeveloped(async ({ examinationId, diagnosis, ownerId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: ownerId,
    message: `Diagnosis and treatment plan ready for your pet`,
    diagnosis,
    pickupInstructions: 'Medications available at front desk'
  })
})
```
