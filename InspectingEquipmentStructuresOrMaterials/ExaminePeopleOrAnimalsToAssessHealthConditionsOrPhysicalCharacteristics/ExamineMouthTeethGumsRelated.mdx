# Examine Mouth Teeth Gums Related

> Business-as-Code definition for oral and dental examination. Models the comprehensive assessment of teeth, gums, oral tissues, and related facial structures performed in dental and medical practices.

## Overview

Oral examination involves systematic visual inspection, palpation, probing, and diagnostic imaging of the mouth, teeth, gums, tongue, and surrounding structures. This work is performed by dentists, dental hygienists, oral surgeons, and maxillofacial specialists to detect decay, disease, trauma, and developmental abnormalities. This definition exposes actions for examination, charting, diagnosis, and treatment planning.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { examineMouthTeethGumsRelated } from '@headlessly/examine-mouth-teeth-gums-related'

const dentalExam = examineMouthTeethGumsRelated()

// Conduct comprehensive oral examination
const exam = await dentalExam.conductOralExam({
  patientId: 'PAT-8471',
  visitType: 'periodic-exam',
  chiefComplaint: 'routine-checkup',
  lastVisit: '2025-08-10'
})

// Chart tooth conditions
await dentalExam.chartTeeth({
  examinationId: exam.id,
  findings: [
    { tooth: 14, condition: 'caries-occlusal', severity: 'moderate' },
    { tooth: 18, condition: 'amalgam-restoration', status: 'intact' },
    { tooth: 30, condition: 'crown-pfm', status: 'intact' }
  ]
})

// Probe periodontal health
await dentalExam.probeGums({
  examinationId: exam.id,
  measurements: [
    { tooth: 14, sites: [3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3], bleeding: false },
    { tooth: 18, sites: [4, 5, 4, 4, 3, 4], bleeding: true }
  ]
})

// Order bitewing radiographs
await dentalExam.orderRadiographs({
  examinationId: exam.id,
  series: 'bitewings',
  reason: 'routine-caries-detection'
})

// Develop treatment plan
await dentalExam.developTreatmentPlan({
  examinationId: exam.id,
  procedures: [
    { code: 'D2391', description: 'Resin-based composite - one surface, posterior', tooth: 14 },
    { code: 'D4341', description: 'Periodontal scaling and root planing - quadrant', quadrant: 'UR' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Flag deep pockets for periodontist referral
dentalExam.gumsProbed(async ({ examinationId, measurements }) => {
  const deepPockets = measurements.filter(m => Math.max(...m.sites) >= 5)
  if (deepPockets.length > 3) {
    await notify({
      to: 'attending-dentist',
      message: `Multiple deep pockets detected, consider periodontal referral`,
      examinationId
    })
  }
})

// Auto-schedule follow-up when treatment plan is created
dentalExam.treatmentPlanDeveloped(async ({ examinationId, patientId, procedures }) => {
  if (procedures.length > 0) {
    await scheduleAppointment({
      patientId,
      type: 'treatment',
      duration: estimateDuration(procedures),
      priority: 'standard'
    })
  }
})
```
