## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { examinePatientsAssessGeneralPhysical } from '@headlessly/examine-patients-assess-general-physical'

const examinations = examinePatientsAssessGeneralPhysical()

// Schedule annual physical examination
const exam = await examinations.scheduleExamination({
  patientId: 'PT-2891',
  providerId: 'DR-4567',
  appointmentDate: '2026-03-15T09:00:00Z',
  examinationType: 'annual_physical'
})

// Record vital signs at start of visit
await examinations.recordVitalSigns({
  examinationId: exam.id,
  bloodPressure: { systolic: 118, diastolic: 76 },
  temperature: 98.4,
  pulse: 72,
  respiration: 16
})

// Document findings after examination
await examinations.documentFindings({
  examinationId: exam.id,
  findings: [
    { system: 'cardiovascular', observation: 'Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs' },
    { system: 'respiratory', observation: 'Clear to auscultation bilaterally' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-order diagnostics for abnormal vital signs
examinations.vitalSignsRecorded(async ({ examinationId, bloodPressure }) => {
  if (bloodPressure.systolic > 140 || bloodPressure.diastolic > 90) {
    await examinations.orderDiagnostics({
      examinationId,
      tests: ['lipid_panel', 'metabolic_panel']
    })
  }
})

// Create referral for specialist evaluation
examinations.findingsDocumented(async ({ examinationId, findings }) => {
  const cardiac = findings.find(f => f.system === 'cardiovascular' && f.abnormal)
  if (cardiac) {
    await examinations.createReferral({
      examinationId,
      specialty: 'cardiology',
      urgency: 'routine'
    })
  }
})
```
