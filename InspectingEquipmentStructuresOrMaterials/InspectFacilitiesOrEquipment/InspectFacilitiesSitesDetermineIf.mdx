# Inspect Facilities Sites Determine If

> Business-as-Code definition for inspecting facilities and sites to determine if they meet specifications and operational standards. Models the complete site qualification process from requirement review through conformance testing and approval.

## Overview

Facility and site inspection determines suitability for specific operational purposes by verifying infrastructure, utilities, environmental conditions, and regulatory compliance. This definition provides actions for site assessment, specification testing, and qualification tracking with events for automated approval workflows and documentation management.

## Actors

| Actor | Description |

| RegulatoryAuthority | Enforces zoning and environmental regulations |
| UtilityProvider | Supplies power, water, and other infrastructure services |
| EnvironmentalConsultant | Assesses site conditions and contamination |
| LegalCounsel | Reviews property rights and compliance obligations |

## Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| SiteInspector | Performs comprehensive facility assessment |
| QualificationEngineer | Validates conformance to technical requirements |

| verifyCompliance | Confirm regulatory and zoning conformance |
| analyzeConformance | Compare findings against specifications |
| issueQualification | Provide formal suitability determination |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| requirementsDefined | Specifications have been established |
| infrastructureInspected | Building systems have been verified |
| utilityCapacityTested | Service availability has been validated |
| environmentalAssessed | Site conditions have been evaluated |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { inspectFacilitiesSitesDetermineIf } from '@headlessly/inspect-facilities-sites-determine-if'

const inspection = inspectFacilitiesSitesDetermineIf()

// Define requirements for manufacturing facility
const requirements = await inspection.defineRequirements({
  projectId: 'MFG-EXPANSION-2026',
  siteAddress: '1250 Industrial Parkway',
  specifications: {
    minFloorArea: '50000 sq ft',
    ceilingHeight: '24 ft minimum',
    electricalService: '2000 Amps, 480V 3-phase',
    waterSupply: '500 GPM',
    hvacCapacity: '200 tons cooling',
    loadingDocks: '6 docks minimum',
    zoning: 'Industrial M-2'
  }
})

// Inspect infrastructure
await inspection.inspectInfrastructure({
  projectId: 'MFG-EXPANSION-2026',
  findings: [
    { system: 'Building Structure', finding: '75000 sq ft clear span', status: 'Meets Spec' },
    { system: 'Ceiling Height', finding: '28 ft', status: 'Exceeds Spec' },
    { system: 'HVAC System', finding: '180 tons installed', status: 'Below Spec' },
    { system: 'Loading Docks', finding: '8 docks', status: 'Exceeds Spec' },
    { system: 'Sprinkler System', finding: 'ESFR compliant', status: 'Meets Spec' }
  ],

  conditions: [
    'HVAC system must be upgraded to 200 ton capacity',

  ],
  validUntil: '2026-08-15',
  approvedBy: 'M.Roberts, Qualification Engineer'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on disqualifying issues
inspection.conformanceAnalyzed(async ({ projectId, findings }) => {
  const critical = findings.filter(f => f.status === 'Below Spec' && f.critical)
  if (critical.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'project-team@company.com',
      priority: 'High',
      subject: `Site disqualification risks - ${projectId}`,
      body: `${critical.length} critical deficiencies identified`
    })
  }
})

// Track conditional approval items
inspection.qualificationIssued(async ({ projectId, decision, conditions }) => {
  if (decision === 'Conditionally Approved') {
    for (const condition of conditions) {
      await createTask({
        taskType: 'Qualification Condition',
        projectId,
        description: condition,
        assignee: 'project-manager',
        priority: 'High'
      })
    }
  }
