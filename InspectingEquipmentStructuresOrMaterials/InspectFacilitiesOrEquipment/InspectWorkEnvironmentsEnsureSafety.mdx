# Inspect Work Environments to Ensure Safety

> Business-as-Code definition for inspecting work environments to ensure safety. Models the workplace safety inspection workflow of evaluating physical conditions, verifying safeguard compliance, identifying unsafe practices, and implementing corrective measures to prevent workplace injuries and illnesses.

## Overview

Inspecting work environments to ensure safety involves conducting routine and targeted assessments of workplace conditions to verify compliance with occupational safety regulations, identify hazardous conditions, and ensure protective measures are in place and functioning. This definition covers housekeeping checks, machine guarding verification, PPE compliance, ergonomic assessments, fire safety inspections, and lockout/tagout audits. It supports OSHA compliance programs, workers compensation loss prevention, corporate safety management systems, and joint health and safety committee operations.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { inspectWorkEnvironmentsEnsureSafety } from '@headlessly/inspect-work-environments-ensure-safety'

const safetyInspection = inspectWorkEnvironmentsEnsureSafety()

// Conduct a monthly safety walkthrough of a manufacturing floor
const walkthrough = await safetyInspection.conductSafetyWalkthrough({
  area: 'machine-shop-building-2',
  inspector: 'SI-2026-0023',
  date: '2026-02-10',
  type: 'monthly-routine'
})

// Verify machine guarding
await safetyInspection.verifyMachineGuarding({
  walkthroughId: walkthrough.id,
  machines: [
    { id: 'CNC-lathe-04', guardType: 'interlocked-enclosure', status: 'compliant' },
    { id: 'bench-grinder-07', guardType: 'adjustable-tongue-guard', status: 'gap-exceeds-spec' },
    { id: 'power-press-01', guardType: 'light-curtain', status: 'compliant' }
  ]
})

// Audit PPE compliance
await safetyInspection.auditPPECompliance({
  walkthroughId: walkthrough.id,
  observations: [
    { area: 'grinding-station', requiredPPE: ['safety-glasses', 'face-shield', 'gloves'], complianceRate: 0.85 },
    { area: 'welding-bay', requiredPPE: ['welding-helmet', 'leather-gloves', 'leather-apron'], complianceRate: 1.0 }
  ]
})

// Document and assign corrective actions
await safetyInspection.documentUnsafeConditions({
  walkthroughId: walkthrough.id,
  conditions: [
    { location: 'bench-grinder-07', description: 'Tongue guard gap exceeds 1/4 inch maximum', severity: 'serious', photos: 2 }
  ]
})

await safetyInspection.assignCorrectiveAction({
  walkthroughId: walkthrough.id,
  actions: [
    { condition: 'bench-grinder-07', action: 'Adjust tongue guard to within 1/4 inch of wheel', responsible: 'maintenance-team', deadline: '2026-02-12' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Shut down equipment when serious guarding deficiencies are found
safetyInspection.machineGuardingVerified(async ({ machines }) => {
  const violations = machines.filter(m => m.status !== 'compliant')
  for (const machine of violations) {
    await equipment.lockout({
      machineId: machine.id,
      reason: `Guarding deficiency: ${machine.status}`
    })
    await notify({
      to: 'maintenance-supervisor',
      message: `${machine.id} locked out: guard ${machine.status}`
    })
  }
})

// Track PPE compliance trends and trigger retraining
safetyInspection.ppeComplianceAudited(async ({ area, requiredPPE, complianceRate }) => {
  if (complianceRate < 0.90) {
    await training.scheduleRefresher({
      topic: 'ppe-requirements',
      area,
      equipment: requiredPPE,
      reason: `Compliance at ${(complianceRate * 100).toFixed(0)}% - below 90% threshold`
    })
  }
})
```
