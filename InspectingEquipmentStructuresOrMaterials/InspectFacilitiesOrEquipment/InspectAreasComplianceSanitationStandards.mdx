# Inspect Areas for Compliance with Sanitation Standards

> Business-as-Code definition for inspecting areas for compliance with sanitation standards. Models the sanitation inspection workflow of evaluating cleanliness, hygiene practices, pest control, and waste management against public health codes and industry sanitation requirements.

## Overview

Inspecting areas for compliance with sanitation standards involves conducting systematic evaluations of food service establishments, healthcare facilities, food processing plants, hospitality venues, and public spaces to verify adherence to sanitation codes, hygiene regulations, and public health requirements. This definition covers surface cleanliness verification, food safety temperature checks, handwashing compliance, pest control assessments, waste disposal audits, and sanitation documentation review. It supports public health departments, food safety programs, healthcare infection control, and hospitality quality management.

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| findInspections | List sanitation inspections by establishment, date, or score |
| getCitations | Retrieve violation citations by establishment, code section, or status |
| getSwabResults | Query surface swab laboratory results by location, surface, or date |
| getTemperatureLogs | Access temperature monitoring data by equipment, date, or compliance status |
| getSanitationScores | Compare sanitation scores across establishments or over time |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { inspectAreasComplianceSanitationStandards } from '@headlessly/inspect-areas-compliance-sanitation-standards'

const sanitationInspection = inspectAreasComplianceSanitationStandards()

// Inspect a restaurant for sanitation compliance
const inspection = await sanitationInspection.inspectFoodHandling({
  establishment: 'riverside-bistro',
  permit: 'FP-2026-0412',
  areas: ['kitchen', 'prep-area', 'walk-in-cooler', 'dry-storage', 'dishwashing'],
  observations: [
    { area: 'prep-area', finding: 'raw-chicken-above-ready-to-eat', violation: true, code: 'FDA-3-302.11' },
    { area: 'kitchen', finding: 'proper-cooking-temps-verified', violation: false }
  ]
})

// Check temperature compliance
await sanitationInspection.checkTemperatureCompliance({
  inspectionId: inspection.id,
  readings: [
    { equipment: 'walk-in-cooler', temp: 38, unit: 'fahrenheit', required: { max: 41 }, status: 'compliant' },
    { equipment: 'hot-holding-steam-table', temp: 128, unit: 'fahrenheit', required: { min: 135 }, status: 'violation' },
    { equipment: 'salad-prep-cooler', temp: 40, unit: 'fahrenheit', required: { max: 41 }, status: 'compliant' }
  ]
})

// Assess surface cleanliness with swab testing
await sanitationInspection.assessSurfaceCleanliness({
  inspectionId: inspection.id,
  swabs: [
    { surface: 'cutting-board-3', result: 'ATP-reading-150', threshold: 200, status: 'pass' },
    { surface: 'slicer-blade', result: 'ATP-reading-450', threshold: 200, status: 'fail' }
  ]
})

// Issue citations and assign score
await sanitationInspection.issueCitation({
  inspectionId: inspection.id,
  violations: [
    { code: 'FDA-3-302.11', description: 'Improper food storage - raw above ready-to-eat', severity: 'critical', correctionDeadline: 'immediate' },
    { code: 'FDA-3-501.16', description: 'Hot holding below 135F', severity: 'major', correctionDeadline: '24-hours' }
  ]
})

await sanitationInspection.assignSanitationScore({
  inspectionId: inspection.id,
  score: 78,
  grade: 'C'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Close establishment when critical violations threaten public health
sanitationInspection.citationIssued(async ({ establishment, violations }) => {
  const critical = violations.filter(v => v.severity === 'critical')
  if (critical.length >= 2) {
    await enforcement.issueClosureOrder({
      establishment,
      reason: `${critical.length} critical sanitation violations`,
      reopenCondition: 'pass-reinspection'
    })
    await notify({
      to: 'public-health-director',
      message: `Closure ordered for ${establishment}: ${critical.length} critical violations`
    })
  }
})

// Publish sanitation scores for public transparency
sanitationInspection.sanitationScoreAssigned(async ({ establishment, score, grade }) => {
  await publicRecords.publishScore({
    establishment,
    score,
    grade,
    inspectionDate: new Date().toISOString()
  })
})
```
