# Inspect Cargo Areas for Cleanliness or Condition

> Business-as-Code definition for inspecting cargo areas for cleanliness or condition. Models the cargo space assessment workflow of examining holds, trailers, containers, and storage areas to verify they are clean, structurally sound, and suitable for loading specific cargo types.

## Overview

Inspecting cargo areas for cleanliness or condition involves examining ship holds, truck trailers, rail cars, aircraft cargo compartments, and warehouse storage zones to verify they are free from contamination, residues, pest activity, and structural damage before loading cargo. This definition covers pre-load inspections, washout verifications, temperature monitoring, structural integrity checks, and cargo compatibility assessments. It supports freight carriers, food-grade logistics operators, chemical transport companies, and warehouse management operations where cargo contamination prevention is essential.

## Actors

| CustomsAuthority | May inspect cargo areas for biosecurity and quarantine compliance |
| InsuranceUnderwriter | Requires cargo area condition documentation for cargo coverage |
| WashoutFacility | Provides cleaning and sanitization services for cargo containers and trailers |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { inspectCargoAreasCleanlinessCondition } from '@headlessly/inspect-cargo-areas-cleanliness-condition'

const cargoInspection = inspectCargoAreasCleanlinessCondition()

// Inspect a refrigerated trailer for food-grade cargo
const inspection = await cargoInspection.examineCleanlinessVisual({
  equipment: 'trailer-ABCD-53R-0412',
  type: 'refrigerated-trailer',
  previousCargo: 'frozen-poultry',
  inspector: 'QA-2026-0078',
  checks: ['floor-debris', 'wall-residue', 'odor', 'drain-condition']
})

await cargoInspection.checkStructuralIntegrity({
  equipmentId: inspection.equipmentId,
  areas: ['floor-boards', 'wall-panels', 'door-seals', 'roof-condition'],
  findings: { doorSealCondition: 'good', floorBoards: 'intact', lightTest: 'no-leaks' }
})

await cargoInspection.verifyWashoutCompletion({
  equipmentId: inspection.equipmentId,
  washoutFacility: 'CleanFleet-Memphis',
  washoutDate: '2026-02-08',
  certificateId: 'WO-2026-0891'
})

await cargoInspection.verifyTemperatureControl({
  equipmentId: inspection.equipmentId,
  unitModel: 'Thermo-King-SB-230',
  setPoint: -18,
  currentTemp: -17.5,
  preCoolDuration: 120
})

// Certify for loading
await cargoInspection.certifySuitability({
  equipmentId: inspection.equipmentId,
  cargo: 'frozen-seafood',
  requiredTemp: -18,
  foodGrade: true
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Reject and schedule washout when cargo area fails cleanliness
cargoInspection.cleanlinessExamined(async ({ equipmentId, rating }) => {
  if (rating === 'fail') {
    await dispatch.holdEquipment({
      equipmentId,
      reason: 'Failed cleanliness inspection - washout required'
    })
    await washout.scheduleService({
      equipmentId,
      priority: 'next-available',
      type: 'full-sanitization'
    })
  }
})

// Alert food safety when pest activity is detected
cargoInspection.pestInspectionCompleted(async ({ equipmentId, pestsFound }) => {
  if (pestsFound) {
    await notify({
      to: 'food-safety-coordinator',
      message: `Pest activity detected in ${equipmentId} - equipment quarantined`
    })
    await dispatch.quarantineEquipment({ equipmentId, reason: 'Pest activity detected' })
  }
})
```
