# Inspect Facilities to Ensure Compliance with Fire Regulations

> Business-as-Code definition for inspecting facilities to ensure compliance with fire regulations. Models the fire safety inspection workflow of evaluating fire protection systems, egress paths, fire separation assemblies, and hazardous materials storage against NFPA codes and local fire prevention ordinances.

## Overview

Inspecting facilities to ensure compliance with fire regulations involves conducting detailed evaluations of fire protection systems, means of egress, fire-rated assemblies, hazardous materials storage, and emergency preparedness to verify conformance with NFPA codes, International Fire Code, and local fire prevention ordinances. This definition covers fire alarm and sprinkler system inspections, egress pathway verification, fire door and damper testing, fire extinguisher servicing, and occupancy load compliance. It supports fire departments, fire marshal offices, insurance loss prevention, and building management operations.

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| findInspections | List fire inspections by building, date, or outcome |
| getViolations | Retrieve fire code violations by building, code section, or status |
| getSprinklerTests | Query sprinkler system test reports by building, date, or result |
| getAlarmTests | Access fire alarm test records by building, device, or date |
| getOccupancyLoads | Look up calculated occupancy loads by building or floor |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { inspectFacilitiesEnsureComplianceFire } from '@headlessly/inspect-facilities-ensure-compliance-fire'

const fireInspection = inspectFacilitiesEnsureComplianceFire()

// Inspect fire alarm system
const alarm = await fireInspection.inspectFireAlarmSystem({
  building: 'midtown-office-tower',
  system: 'Notifier-NFS2-3030',
  tests: [
    { device: 'smoke-detector-floor-3-zone-A', type: 'photoelectric', result: 'pass' },
    { device: 'pull-station-stairwell-B-floor-5', type: 'manual', result: 'pass' },
    { device: 'horn-strobe-corridor-floor-7', type: 'notification', result: 'fail-dim' }
  ],
  monitoringSignal: 'verified-central-station'
})

// Inspect sprinkler system
await fireInspection.inspectSprinklerSystem({
  building: 'midtown-office-tower',
  system: 'wet-pipe',
  tests: [
    { test: 'main-drain-flow', staticPsi: 95, residualPsi: 82, result: 'pass' },
    { test: 'inspector-test-valve', flowSwitch: 'activated-within-90-seconds', result: 'pass' },
    { test: 'visual-heads', painted: 0, corroded: 2, obstructed: 0 }
  ]
})

// Verify egress paths
await fireInspection.verifyEgressPaths({
  building: 'midtown-office-tower',
  floors: [
    { floor: 3, exitCount: 2, travelDistance: 180, maxAllowed: 250, obstructions: [] },
    { floor: 7, exitCount: 2, travelDistance: 200, maxAllowed: 250, obstructions: ['storage-in-corridor'] }
  ]
})

// Issue violation for obstruction
await fireInspection.issueFireCodeViolation({
  building: 'midtown-office-tower',
  violations: [
    { code: 'NFPA-1-10.3.2', description: 'Storage in exit corridor on floor 7', severity: 'serious', correctionDeadline: '48-hours' },
    { code: 'NFPA-72-10.6.7', description: 'Notification appliance dim on floor 7', severity: 'moderate', correctionDeadline: '30-days' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Restrict occupancy when life safety violations are found
fireInspection.fireCodeViolationIssued(async ({ building, violations }) => {
  const lifeSafety = violations.filter(v => v.severity === 'critical' || v.code.includes('egress'))
  if (lifeSafety.length > 0) {
    await buildingOps.restrictOccupancy({
      building,
      restriction: 'reduced-capacity',
      reason: `Fire code violations affecting life safety`
    })
    await notify({
      to: 'building-fire-safety-director',
      message: `${building}: ${lifeSafety.length} life safety violation(s) require immediate correction`
    })
  }
})

// Schedule sprinkler maintenance when test results indicate issues
fireInspection.sprinklerSystemInspected(async ({ building, tests }) => {
  const corroded = tests.find(t => t.test === 'visual-heads' && t.corroded > 0)
  if (corroded) {
    await maintenance.scheduleService({
      building,
      system: 'fire-sprinkler',
      task: `Replace ${corroded.corroded} corroded sprinkler heads`,
      priority: 'within-30-days'
    })
  }
})
```
