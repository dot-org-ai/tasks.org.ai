# Inspect Facilities to Ensure Compliance with Safety Standards

> Business-as-Code definition for inspecting facilities to ensure compliance with safety, quality, or service standards. Models the compliance inspection lifecycle from standards mapping through finding resolution and certification.

## Overview

Inspecting facilities to ensure compliance with safety, quality, or service standards involves evaluating physical spaces against applicable regulatory codes, industry standards, and organizational policies. Inspectors assess fire protection systems, emergency egress, ADA accessibility, food safety practices, hazardous material storage, electrical code compliance, occupancy limits, and workplace safety conditions. This activity supports healthcare accreditation, hospitality quality programs, manufacturing safety audits, educational facility assessments, and general workplace compliance. Findings are documented as citations with required corrective timelines.

## Actors

| Actor | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| FireMarshal | Enforces fire code compliance including suppression systems, egress, and occupancy |

| AccreditingBody | Evaluates facility compliance for industry-specific accreditation programs |
| FacilityOwner | Responsible for maintaining the facility in compliance with applicable standards |
| BuildingDepartment | Enforces building codes related to structural, mechanical, and electrical systems |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { inspectFacilitiesToEnsureComplianceWithSafetyStandards } from '@headlessly/inspect-facilities-to-ensure-compliance-with-safety-standards'

const inspector = inspectFacilitiesToEnsureComplianceWithSafetyStandards()

// Schedule a compliance inspection for a restaurant
const inspection = await inspector.scheduleComplianceInspection({
  facilityId: 'FAC-REST-1150',
  facilityType: 'foodService',
  inspectionType: 'routine',
  assignedTo: 'inspector-lmorales'
})

// Map applicable standards for the facility type
const standards = await inspector.mapApplicableStandards({
  facilityId: 'FAC-REST-1150',
  applicableCodes: ['fireCode', 'healthCode', 'buildingCode', 'adaAccessibility']
})

// Evaluate fire protection systems
await inspector.evaluateFireProtection({
  inspectionId: inspection.id,
  findings: [
    { item: 'sprinklerSystem', status: 'compliant', lastServiceDate: '2025-11-15' },
    { item: 'exitSigns', status: 'compliant' },
    { item: 'fireExtinguishers', status: 'nonCompliant', note: 'Kitchen extinguisher expired 2025-09-30' },
    { item: 'egressPaths', status: 'compliant' }
  ]
})

// Issue citation for expired fire extinguisher
await inspector.issueCitation({
  inspectionId: inspection.id,
  codeSection: 'IFC-906.2',
  violation: 'Fire extinguisher past annual service date',
  location: 'kitchen',
  correctionDeadline: '2026-03-15',
  severity: 'moderate'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify facility owners when citations are issued
inspector.citationIssued(async ({ facilityId, codeSection, violation, correctionDeadline }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'facility-owner',
    message: `Citation issued for ${facilityId}: ${codeSection} - ${violation}. Correction required by ${correctionDeadline}.`
  })
})

// Auto-schedule re-inspection when corrective action deadline approaches
inspector.citationIssued(async ({ facilityId, inspectionId, correctionDeadline }) => {
  await inspector.scheduleComplianceInspection({
    facilityId,
    inspectionType: 'reinspection',
    parentInspectionId: inspectionId,
    scheduledDate: correctionDeadline
  })
})
```
