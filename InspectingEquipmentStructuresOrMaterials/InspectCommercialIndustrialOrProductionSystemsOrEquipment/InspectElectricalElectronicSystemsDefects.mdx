# Inspect Electrical or Electronic Systems for Defects

> Business-as-Code definition for inspecting electrical and electronic systems to identify defects. Models the inspection lifecycle from circuit testing through thermal analysis and defect classification.

## Overview

Inspecting electrical or electronic systems for defects involves systematically examining wiring, circuit boards, control panels, power distribution units, programmable logic controllers, and integrated electronic assemblies to identify faults such as short circuits, ground faults, insulation degradation, solder joint failures, and component drift. Technicians use multimeters, oscilloscopes, thermal imaging cameras, and insulation resistance testers to detect issues before they cause equipment failure, safety hazards, or production downtime. The process applies across manufacturing, building infrastructure, transportation, and industrial automation contexts.

## Actors

| Actor | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| EquipmentManufacturer | Provides wiring diagrams, component specifications, and known defect bulletins |
| ElectricalCodeAuthority | Enforces compliance with NEC, IEC, or local electrical safety codes |
| ComponentSupplier | Furnishes replacement parts, circuit boards, and electronic modules |
| FacilityOwner | Authorizes inspections and provides access to electrical infrastructure |
| InsuranceUnderwriter | Requires periodic electrical inspection reports for coverage eligibility |
| TestEquipmentCalibrationLab | Certifies accuracy of measurement instruments used during inspections |

## Roles

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { inspectElectricalOrElectronicSystemsForDefects } from '@headlessly/inspect-electrical-or-electronic-systems-for-defects'

const inspector = inspectElectricalOrElectronicSystemsForDefects()

// Start inspection of a motor control center
const inspection = await inspector.initiateSystemInspection({
  systemId: 'MCC-BLDG4-PANEL-A',
  systemType: 'motorControlCenter',
  inspectionType: 'scheduled',
  assignedTo: 'tech-rwilliams'
})

// Record electrical measurements at test points
await inspector.measureElectricalParameters({
  inspectionId: inspection.id,
  measurements: [
    { testPoint: 'TP-01', parameter: 'insulationResistance', value: 2.1, unit: 'megaohms' },
    { testPoint: 'TP-02', parameter: 'voltage', value: 479.3, unit: 'V', phase: 'A-B' },
    { testPoint: 'TP-03', parameter: 'current', value: 42.7, unit: 'A', phase: 'A' }
  ]
})

// Conduct thermal scan and classify any anomalies
const scan = await inspector.conductThermalScan({
  inspectionId: inspection.id,
  scanArea: 'main-bus-connections',
  ambientTemp: 24.5,
  unit: 'celsius'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Escalate when thermal anomalies are detected
inspector.thermalAnomalyDetected(async ({ systemId, location, temperature, threshold }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'electrical-maintenance',
    priority: 'high',
    message: `Thermal anomaly at ${location} on ${systemId}: ${temperature}C exceeds ${threshold}C threshold`
  })
})

// Track defect trends for reliability analysis
inspector.defectClassified(async ({ systemId, defectType, severity }) => {
  if (severity === 'critical') {
    await notify({
      to: 'reliability-engineering',
      message: `Critical ${defectType} defect on ${systemId} requires immediate attention`
    })
  }
})
```
