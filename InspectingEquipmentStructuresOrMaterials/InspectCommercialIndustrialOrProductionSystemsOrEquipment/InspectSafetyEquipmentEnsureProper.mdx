# Inspect Safety Equipment Ensure Proper

> Business-as-Code definition for inspecting safety equipment to ensure proper functioning. Models the complete safety equipment inspection lifecycle from scheduling through testing, certification, and replacement planning for fire protection, personal protective, and emergency response equipment.

## Overview

Safety equipment inspection ensures that fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, sprinkler systems, emergency lighting, fall protection gear, personal protective equipment, and other life-safety devices are functioning correctly and ready for use when needed. Regular inspections are mandated by OSHA, NFPA, and local fire codes, with specific intervals for different equipment types. Inspectors verify physical condition, test functionality, check expiration dates, and confirm that equipment is accessible and properly maintained.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { inspectSafetyEquipmentEnsureProper } from '@headlessly/inspect-safety-equipment-ensure-proper'

const safety = inspectSafetyEquipmentEnsureProper()

// Schedule monthly fire extinguisher inspections
const schedule = await safety.scheduleInspection({
  type: 'fire-extinguisher',
  facility: 'Main Office Building',
  frequency: 'monthly',
  startDate: '2026-03-01'
})

// Test functionality of a fire extinguisher
await safety.testFunctionality({
  deviceId: 'FE-2026-0112',
  type: 'fire-extinguisher',
  tests: [
    { check: 'pressure-gauge', result: 'pass', reading: 'green-zone' },
    { check: 'pin-and-tamper-seal', result: 'pass' },
    { check: 'hose-condition', result: 'fail', notes: 'Cracked nozzle' }
  ]
})

// Order replacement for failed device
await safety.orderReplacement({
  deviceId: 'FE-2026-0112',
  reason: 'Cracked nozzle - not repairable',
  replacementType: 'ABC-dry-chemical-10lb',
  priority: 'standard'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert EHS manager when critical safety equipment fails
safety.functionalityTested(async ({ deviceId, type, passed }) => {
  if (!passed && ['fire-extinguisher', 'smoke-detector', 'emergency-light'].includes(type)) {
    await notify({
      to: 'ehs-manager',
      message: `${type} ${deviceId} failed functional test - replacement needed`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-flag expiring equipment 30 days before deadline
safety.expirationDetected(async ({ deviceId, expirationDate }) => {
  await safety.orderReplacement({
    deviceId,
    reason: `Expiring on ${expirationDate}`,
    priority: 'planned'
  })
})
```
