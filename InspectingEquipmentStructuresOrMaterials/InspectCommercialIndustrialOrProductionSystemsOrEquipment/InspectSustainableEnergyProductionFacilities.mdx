# Inspect Sustainable Energy Production Facilities

> Business-as-Code definition for inspecting sustainable energy production facilities and equipment. Models the inspection process for solar, wind, geothermal, and hydroelectric installations from performance monitoring through component examination, degradation analysis, and maintenance planning.

## Overview

Inspecting sustainable energy production facilities involves examining solar panels, wind turbines, geothermal systems, battery storage, inverters, and associated electrical infrastructure to ensure optimal energy output, structural integrity, and regulatory compliance. Inspectors use thermal imaging, electrical testing, visual assessment, and performance data analysis to detect panel degradation, turbine blade damage, inverter faults, and connection issues. These inspections protect capital investments and maintain energy production targets.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { inspectSustainableEnergyProductionFacilities } from '@headlessly/inspect-sustainable-energy-production-facilities'

const energy = inspectSustainableEnergyProductionFacilities()

// Analyze performance data for a solar farm
const analysis = await energy.analyzePerformanceData({
  facility: 'Sunfield Solar Farm',
  period: { start: '2026-01-01', end: '2026-03-01' },
  baseline: 'design-capacity-v2'
})

// Conduct thermal scan on underperforming sections
const scan = await energy.conductThermalScan({
  facility: 'Sunfield Solar Farm',
  sections: ['Array-B3', 'Array-B4'],
  instrument: 'FLIR-T650sc'
})

// Schedule maintenance for detected hotspots
await energy.schedulePreventiveMaintenance({
  facility: 'Sunfield Solar Farm',
  items: [
    { component: 'Panel-B3-22', issue: 'hotspot-bypass-diode', priority: 'high' },
    { component: 'Inverter-B3', issue: 'efficiency-drop', priority: 'medium' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert plant manager on significant performance degradation
energy.performanceDegradationFound(async ({ facility, variance }) => {
  if (variance > 10) {
    await notify({
      to: 'plant-manager',
      message: `${facility} performance ${variance}% below baseline - inspection recommended`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-report inverter faults to manufacturer
energy.inverterFaultDetected(async ({ facility, inverterId, faultCode }) => {
  await support.createTicket({
    vendor: 'inverter-manufacturer',
    equipment: inverterId,
    facility,
    faultCode,
    type: 'warranty-claim'
  })
})
```
