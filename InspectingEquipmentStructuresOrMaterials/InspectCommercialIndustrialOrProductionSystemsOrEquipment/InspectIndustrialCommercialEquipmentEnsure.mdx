# Inspect Industrial or Commercial Equipment

> Business-as-Code definition for inspecting industrial and commercial equipment to ensure proper operation. Models the inspection process for heavy-duty machinery, HVAC systems, refrigeration units, elevators, and commercial processing equipment.

## Overview

Inspecting industrial or commercial equipment involves examining boilers, compressors, conveyors, elevators, escalators, HVAC systems, commercial refrigeration units, industrial ovens, and large-scale processing machinery to confirm they operate within manufacturer specifications and regulatory requirements. Inspectors verify operating pressures, temperatures, vibration levels, safety interlocks, and control system responses. This activity ensures equipment reliability in factories, warehouses, commercial buildings, hospitals, and retail environments where equipment failure can cause safety hazards, regulatory violations, or significant business disruption.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { inspectIndustrialOrCommercialEquipment } from '@headlessly/inspect-industrial-or-commercial-equipment'

const inspector = inspectIndustrialOrCommercialEquipment()

// Schedule an annual boiler inspection
const inspection = await inspector.scheduleInspection({
  equipmentId: 'BOILER-MAIN-001',
  equipmentType: 'steamBoiler',
  facilityId: 'plant-west',
  regulatoryInterval: 'annual',
  assignedTo: 'inspector-certified-dpatel'
})

// Measure operating parameters
await inspector.measureOperatingParameters({
  inspectionId: inspection.id,
  parameters: [
    { name: 'steamPressure', value: 148, unit: 'psi', maxAllowed: 150 },
    { name: 'waterTemperature', value: 365, unit: 'fahrenheit' },
    { name: 'stackTemperature', value: 425, unit: 'fahrenheit' },
    { name: 'vibration', value: 2.8, unit: 'mm/s' }
  ]
})

// Test safety devices
await inspector.testSafetyDevices({
  inspectionId: inspection.id,
  devices: [
    { name: 'pressureReliefValve', setPoint: 155, unit: 'psi', actuated: true },
    { name: 'lowWaterCutoff', triggered: true },
    { name: 'flameFailureSafeguard', responseTime: 4, unit: 'seconds', passed: true }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert facility management when deficiency notices are issued
inspector.deficiencyNoticeIssued(async ({ equipmentId, deficiencyType, severity }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'facilities-management',
    priority: severity === 'critical' ? 'urgent' : 'normal',
    message: `Deficiency on ${equipmentId}: ${deficiencyType} (${severity})`
  })
})

// Auto-renew inspection schedule when certificate is issued
inspector.certificateIssued(async ({ equipmentId, certificateExpiry }) => {
  await inspector.scheduleInspection({
    equipmentId,
    scheduledDate: certificateExpiry,
    inspectionType: 'recertification'
  })
})
```
