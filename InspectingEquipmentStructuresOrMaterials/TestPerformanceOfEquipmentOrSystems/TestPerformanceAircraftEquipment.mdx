# Test Performance Aircraft Equipment

> Business-as-Code definition for aircraft equipment performance testing. Validates avionics, propulsion, hydraulics, and flight control systems to ensure airworthiness and regulatory compliance.

## Overview

Aircraft equipment performance testing verifies that navigation systems, engines, flight controls, and other critical components meet stringent aviation standards. This definition provides actions for functional testing, performance validation, and airworthiness certification of aircraft systems and equipment.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { testPerformanceAircraftEquipment } from '@headlessly/test-performance-aircraft-equipment'

const testing = testPerformanceAircraftEquipment()

// Test avionics systems
const avionics = await testing.testAvionics({
  aircraftId: 'N12345-boeing-737',
  systems: ['autopilot', 'ils', 'tcas', 'fms'],
  duration: 120
})

// Check propulsion
const propulsion = await testing.checkPropulsion({
  aircraftId: 'N12345-boeing-737',
  engines: ['engine-1', 'engine-2'],
  tests: ['idle', 'cruise-power', 'max-thrust'],
  duration: 300
})

// Test flight controls
await testing.testFlightControls({
  aircraftId: 'N12345-boeing-737',
  controls: ['ailerons', 'elevators', 'rudder', 'flaps', 'spoilers'],
  ranges: 'full'
})

// Conduct flight test
const flightTest = await testing.conductFlightTest({
  aircraftId: 'N12345-boeing-737',
  flightPlan: 'test-profile-A',
  duration: 180,
  validations: ['avionics', 'propulsion', 'flight-controls', 'hydraulics']
})

// Certify airworthiness
await testing.certifyAirworthiness({
  aircraftId: 'N12345-boeing-737',
  testResults: [avionics.id, propulsion.id, flightTest.id],
  standard: 'FAA-Part-25',
  certifiedBy: 'inspector-FAA-456'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on critical system failure
testing.avionicsTested(async ({ aircraftId, system, result }) => {
  if (result.status === 'failed' && system.criticality === 'dispatch') {
    await groundAircraft({
      aircraftId,
      reason: `Critical avionics system ${system.name} failed test`
    })
  }
})

// Schedule maintenance on performance degradation
testing.propulsionChecked(async ({ aircraftId, engine, performance }) => {
  if (performance.thrust < performance.rated * 0.95) {
    await scheduleMaintenance({
      aircraftId,
      component: engine,
      reason: 'thrust-degradation',
      priority: 'high'
    })
  }
})
```
