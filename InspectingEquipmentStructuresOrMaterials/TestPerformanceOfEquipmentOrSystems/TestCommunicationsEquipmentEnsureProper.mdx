# Test Communications Equipment Ensure Proper

> Business-as-Code definition for communications equipment testing. Validates radio systems, network devices, and transmission equipment for reliability and signal quality.

## Overview

Communications equipment testing verifies that radio transceivers, network switches, antennas, and other transmission devices operate within specifications. This definition provides actions for signal testing, connectivity validation, and performance certification of communications infrastructure.

## Actors

| Actor | Description |

| EquipmentVendor | Provides communications hardware and specifications |
| NetworkOperator | Manages communications infrastructure |
| EndUser | Relies on communications equipment for operations |
| RegulatoryAgency | Enforces spectrum and emissions compliance |
| FieldTechnician | Installs and maintains communications equipment |
| ServiceProvider | Delivers connectivity services using equipment |

## Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| CommunicationsEngineer | Tests and certifies communications equipment |
| SignalAnalyst | Measures RF characteristics and signal quality |
| NetworkTechnician | Validates data transmission and connectivity |
| ComplianceSpecialist | Ensures equipment meets regulatory requirements |

## Entities

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { testCommunicationsEquipmentEnsureProper } from '@headlessly/test-communications-equipment-ensure-proper'

const testing = testCommunicationsEquipmentEnsureProper()

// Test radio signal strength
const signal = await testing.testSignalStrength({
  equipmentId: 'radio-base-station-12',
  frequency: 850,
  testPoints: ['indoor', 'outdoor', 'edge-of-coverage']
})

// Validate operating frequency
await testing.validateFrequency({
  equipmentId: 'radio-base-station-12',
  nominalFrequency: 850.25,
  tolerance: 0.001
})

// Test network connectivity
const connectivity = await testing.testConnectivity({
  equipmentId: 'network-switch-05',
  testDuration: 300,
  trafficPattern: 'full-duplex',
  throughput: 1000
})

// Verify regulatory compliance
const compliance = await testing.verifyCompliance({
  equipmentId: 'radio-base-station-12',
  standards: ['FCC-Part-15', 'ETSI-EN-301-489']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-certify compliant equipment
testing.complianceVerified(async ({ equipmentId, standards, results }) => {
  if (results.every((r) => r.passed)) {
    await testing.certifyEquipment({
      equipmentId,
      standards,
      validUntil: '2027-02-05'
    })
  }
})

// Alert on signal quality degradation
testing.modulationChecked(async ({ equipmentId, signalQuality, threshold }) => {
  if (signalQuality < threshold) {
    await notify({
      to: 'network-operations',
      message: `Equipment ${equipmentId} signal quality below acceptable level`
    })
  }
})
```
