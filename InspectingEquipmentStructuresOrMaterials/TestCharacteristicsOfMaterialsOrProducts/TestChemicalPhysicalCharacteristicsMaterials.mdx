# Test Chemical or Physical Characteristics of Materials or Products

> Business-as-Code definition for testing chemical or physical characteristics of materials or products. Models the analytical characterization workflow of selecting methods, preparing samples, performing instrumental and wet-chemistry analyses, and reporting measured properties against acceptance specifications.

## Overview

Testing chemical or physical characteristics of materials or products involves applying analytical chemistry, spectroscopy, chromatography, thermal analysis, and physical measurement techniques to determine the composition, purity, density, viscosity, melting point, particle size, and other properties of raw materials, intermediate products, and finished goods. This definition covers method selection, sample preparation, instrument operation, quality control checks, and certificate-of-analysis generation. It supports pharmaceutical manufacturing, chemical production, food processing, polymer engineering, and metallurgical quality assurance.

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| methodSelected | A validated analytical method has been chosen for the characterization |
| samplePrepared | Sample conditioning steps are complete and the specimen is ready |
| instrumentCalibrated | Reference standards have established valid response curves |
| analysisExecuted | Instrument measurements have been collected |
| dataProcessed | Raw signals have been converted to quantitative property values |
| qualityControlPassed | Control sample results confirm measurement accuracy |
| qualityControlFailed | Control sample results indicate a measurement accuracy problem |
| specificationMet | Measured values fall within acceptance criteria |
| specificationFailed | Measured values fall outside acceptance criteria |
| certificateIssued | A certificate of analysis has been produced and authorized |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { testChemicalPhysicalCharacteristicsMaterials } from '@headlessly/test-chemical-physical-characteristics-materials'

const charTest = testChemicalPhysicalCharacteristicsMaterials()

// Select method for polymer characterization
const method = await charTest.selectMethod({
  material: 'polyethylene-HDPE',
  properties: ['melt-flow-index', 'density', 'tensile-strength', 'ash-content'],
  standards: ['ASTM-D1238', 'ASTM-D792', 'ASTM-D638', 'ASTM-D5630']
})

// Prepare sample and calibrate
await charTest.prepareSample({
  methodId: method.id,
  sampleId: 'RM-2026-HDPE-0445',
  preparation: ['pellet-conditioning-23C-50RH', 'compression-molding']
})

await charTest.calibrateInstrument({
  instrument: 'MFI-tester-01',
  standard: 'NIST-SRM-1473a',
  temperature: 190,
  load: 2.16
})

// Execute analysis and process results
const run = await charTest.executeAnalysis({
  methodId: method.id,
  sampleId: 'RM-2026-HDPE-0445',
  replicates: 5
})

const results = await charTest.processData({
  runId: run.id,
  calculations: ['mean', 'rsd', 'uncertainty']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Quarantine material when specification fails
charTest.specificationFailed(async ({ sampleId, property, measuredValue, specification }) => {
  await inventory.quarantine({
    materialId: sampleId,
    reason: `${property} = ${measuredValue} (spec: ${specification.min}-${specification.max})`
  })
  await notify({
    to: 'quality-control',
    message: `Out-of-spec result on ${sampleId}: ${property}`
  })
})

// Rerun analysis when quality control fails
charTest.qualityControlFailed(async ({ runId, instrument, controlSample }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'lab-supervisor',
    message: `QC failure on ${instrument}: control sample ${controlSample} out of range`
  })
  await charTest.calibrateInstrument({
    instrument,
    standard: controlSample,
    forceRecalibration: true
  })
})
```
