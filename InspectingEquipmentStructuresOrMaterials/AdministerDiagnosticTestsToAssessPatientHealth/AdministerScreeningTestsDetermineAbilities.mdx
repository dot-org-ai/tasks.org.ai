# Administer Screening Tests to Determine Abilities or Treatment Needs

> Business-as-Code definition for administering screening tests to determine abilities or treatment needs. Models the clinical and rehabilitation workflow of selecting, administering, scoring, and interpreting standardized assessments that guide care planning and intervention decisions.

## Overview

Administering screening tests to determine abilities or treatment needs involves selecting validated assessment instruments, conducting standardized evaluations of cognitive, physical, developmental, or functional capacity, and using the results to guide therapeutic intervention. This definition covers the workflow from referral and instrument selection through test administration, scoring, and care plan integration. It supports occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech-language pathology, psychology, and rehabilitation medicine settings.

| InsurancePayer | Authorizes and reimburses screening procedures |
| PatientOrClient | The individual being assessed for abilities or treatment needs |
| Caregiver | Provides collateral information about the patient's functional abilities |
| AccreditationBoard | Sets professional standards for screening administration and interpretation |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { administerScreeningTestsDetermineAbilities } from '@headlessly/administer-screening-tests-determine-abilities'

const screening = administerScreeningTestsDetermineAbilities()

// Receive a referral for cognitive screening
const referral = await screening.receiveReferral({
  patientId: 'PT-2026-03291',
  reason: 'memory-complaints-post-stroke',
  referringProvider: 'DR-MARTINEZ',
  domains: ['cognition', 'executive-function', 'memory']
})

// Select and administer the assessment
const instrument = await screening.selectInstrument({
  referralId: referral.id,
  domain: 'cognition',
  population: 'adult-neurological',
  instrument: 'MoCA'
})

await screening.obtainConsent({ referralId: referral.id, method: 'verbal-with-witness' })

const session = await screening.administerScreening({
  referralId: referral.id,
  instrumentId: instrument.id,
  setting: 'outpatient-rehab',
  duration: 20
})

// Score, interpret, and report
const scores = await screening.scoreResults({ sessionId: session.id })
await screening.interpretFindings({
  sessionId: session.id,
  normativeGroup: 'age-education-matched'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-generate recommendations when findings are interpreted
screening.findingsInterpreted(async ({ sessionId, patientId, severity }) => {
  await screening.generateRecommendations({
    sessionId,
    includeServices: ['occupational-therapy', 'speech-therapy', 'neuropsychology']
  })
})

// Escalate significant deficits to the care team
screening.resultsScored(async ({ patientId, scores, cutoffs }) => {
  const significantDeficits = scores.filter(s => s.value < cutoffs[s.domain])
  if (significantDeficits.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'care-team',
      message: `Significant deficits detected in ${significantDeficits.map(d => d.domain).join(', ')} for patient ${patientId}`
    })
  }
})
```
