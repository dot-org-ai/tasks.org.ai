# Test Patient Nervous System Functioning

> Business-as-Code definition for testing patient nervous system functioning. Models the neurodiagnostic workflow of ordering, administering, recording, and interpreting electroencephalography, nerve conduction studies, electromyography, and evoked potential tests.

## Overview

Testing patient nervous system functioning involves performing specialized neurodiagnostic procedures to assess brain electrical activity, peripheral nerve conduction velocity, neuromuscular junction integrity, and sensory pathway function. This definition covers EEG monitoring, nerve conduction studies, needle EMG, and evoked potential testing from order entry through setup, recording, interpretation, and clinical reporting. It supports neurology clinics, epilepsy monitoring units, and intraoperative neurophysiology programs.

## Actors

| studyOrdered | A neurodiagnostic procedure has been requested |
| patientPrepared | Electrodes are applied and impedances verified |
| eegRecorded | Brain electrical activity has been captured |
| nerveStudyCompleted | Peripheral nerve conduction measurements are finished |
| emgCompleted | Needle EMG recordings are finished |
| evokedPotentialRecorded | Sensory evoked potential data has been captured |
| recordingInterpreted | A clinical interpretation of the neurodiagnostic data is available |
| abnormalityDetected | An abnormal finding requiring clinical attention has been identified |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| findStudies | List neurodiagnostic studies by patient, type, or date |
| getRecordings | Retrieve EEG, NCS, or EMG recordings for a specific study |
| getAbnormalities | Find studies with flagged abnormal findings |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { testPatientNervousSystemFunctioning } from '@headlessly/test-patient-nervous-system-functioning'

const neurodiag = testPatientNervousSystemFunctioning()

// Order an EEG for seizure evaluation
const order = await neurodiag.orderStudy({
  patientId: 'PT-2026-09107',
  studyType: 'routine-EEG',
  indication: 'new-onset-seizures',
  referringPhysician: 'DR-NAKAMURA',
  duration: 30
})

// Prepare and record
await neurodiag.preparePatient({
  orderId: order.id,
  montage: 'international-10-20',
  impedanceTarget: 5000
})

const recording = await neurodiag.recordEEG({
  orderId: order.id,
  activations: ['hyperventilation', 'photic-stimulation'],
  duration: 30
})

// Interpret and report
const interpretation = await neurodiag.interpretRecording({
  recordingId: recording.id,
  interpreter: 'DR-NAKAMURA'
})

await neurodiag.issueReport({
  orderId: order.id,
  interpretationId: interpretation.id
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Escalate epileptiform activity for urgent neurologist review
neurodiag.abnormalityDetected(async ({ patientId, studyType, finding }) => {
  if (finding.includes('epileptiform')) {
    await notify({
      to: 'on-call-neurologist',
      message: `Epileptiform activity detected on ${studyType} for patient ${patientId}`,
      priority: 'urgent'
    })
  }
})

// Auto-schedule follow-up for abnormal findings
neurodiag.recordingInterpreted(async ({ patientId, abnormal, studyType }) => {
  if (abnormal) {
    await scheduling.bookAppointment({
      patientId,
      specialty: 'neurology',
      reason: `Abnormal ${studyType} - follow-up`,
      urgency: 'within-1-week'
    })
