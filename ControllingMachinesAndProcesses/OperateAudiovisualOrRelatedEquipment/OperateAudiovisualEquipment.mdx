| EventOrganizer | Requests AV services and defines presentation requirements |
| AVVendor | Supplies projectors, displays, mixers, and related hardware |
| Presenter | Delivers content using the audiovisual setup |
| FacilityManager | Provides venue access and coordinates room configurations |
| ContentProvider | Supplies media files, slides, and video feeds for display |

## Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| AVTechnician | Sets up, operates, and troubleshoots audiovisual systems |
| AVSupervisor | Plans equipment allocation and oversees technician assignments |
| SystemsEngineer | Designs and maintains permanent AV installations |
| MediaOperator | Manages playback and switching of audio and video sources |

## Entities

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Equipment | A projector, display, speaker, mixer, or switcher used in AV setups |
| AVSetup | A configured arrangement of equipment for a specific event or room |
| SignalRoute | A defined path for audio or video signals between source and output |
| SessionLog | A record of an AV session including start time, duration, and issues |
| Inventory | The catalog of available AV equipment and its current status |
| TroubleTicket | A logged issue with AV equipment requiring resolution |

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| configureSetup | Arrange and connect AV equipment for a venue or event |
| routeSignal | Direct audio or video from a source to one or more outputs |
| startSession | Begin an AV session and confirm all systems are live |
| endSession | Shut down AV equipment and log session details |
| adjustLevels | Modify audio volume, video brightness, or display settings |
| troubleshootIssue | Diagnose and resolve a technical problem with AV equipment |
| logEquipmentUsage | Record hours and condition of equipment after use |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| setupConfigured | AV equipment has been arranged and connected for an event |
| signalRouted | An audio or video signal path has been established |
| sessionStarted | An AV session is live and all systems are operational |
| sessionEnded | An AV session has been concluded and equipment powered down |
| levelsAdjusted | Audio or video output levels have been changed |
| issueDetected | A technical problem has been identified with AV equipment |
| issueResolved | A previously reported AV issue has been fixed |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| findEquipment | List AV equipment by type, location, or availability |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { operateAudiovisualEquipment } from '@headlessly/operate-audiovisual-equipment'

const av = operateAudiovisualEquipment()

// Configure AV setup for a conference room
const setup = await av.configureSetup({
  venue: 'Main Conference Hall',
  equipment: ['projector-epson-5050', 'mixer-yamaha-tf1', 'display-samsung-85'],
  layout: 'theater'
})

// Route presenter laptop to main display
await av.routeSignal({
  setupId: setup.id,
  source: 'hdmi-input-1',
  outputs: ['projector-main', 'display-confidence']
})

// Start the session
await av.startSession({
  setupId: setup.id,
  eventName: 'Q1 All-Hands Meeting',
  expectedDuration: { minutes: 90 }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-notify technician on issue detection
av.issueDetected(async ({ setupId, equipmentId, description }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'av-technician-on-call',
    message: `AV issue in setup ${setupId}: ${description} (${equipmentId})`
  })
})

// Log usage and schedule maintenance after session ends
av.sessionEnded(async ({ setupId, equipmentIds, duration }) => {
  for (const equipmentId of equipmentIds) {
    await av.logEquipmentUsage({ equipmentId, hours: duration.hours })
  }
})
```
