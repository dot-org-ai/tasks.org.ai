## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { operateStillVideoCameras } from '@headlessly/operate-still-video-cameras-related'

const camera = operateStillVideoCameras()

// Configure camera for a portrait session
await camera.configureCamera({
  cameraId: 'canon-r5-001',
  iso: 400,
  aperture: 2.8,
  shutterSpeed: '1/200',
  whiteBalance: 'daylight',
  format: 'RAW'
})

// Capture a series of images
const image = await camera.captureImage({
  cameraId: 'canon-r5-001',
  shotListItem: 'headshot-formal-01',
  burstMode: false
})

// Ingest media to storage
await camera.ingestMedia({
  mediaCardId: 'cfexpress-card-a',
  destination: 'project-corporate-headshots/raw',
  verifyChecksum: true
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-tag ingested media with session metadata
camera.mediaIngested(async ({ sessionId, assetIds, projectId }) => {
  for (const assetId of assetIds) {
    await camera.tagMediaAssets({
      assetId,
      tags: { sessionId, projectId, ingestionDate: new Date().toISOString() }
    })
  }
})

// Notify post-production when review is complete
camera.capturesReviewed(async ({ sessionId, approvedCount, flaggedCount }) => {
  if (flaggedCount === 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'post-production-studio',
      message: `Session ${sessionId}: all ${approvedCount} captures approved and ready for editing`
    })
  }
})
```
