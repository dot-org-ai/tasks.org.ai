# Operate Precision Equipment Control Microscopic

> Business-as-Code definition for precision equipment operation at microscopic and nanoscopic scales. Models instrument control, process parameter management, and nanoscale fabrication or characterization workflows.

## Overview

Operating precision equipment to control microscopic or nanoscopic processes involves using electron microscopes, atomic force microscopes, lithography systems, and other nanoscale instruments for fabrication, characterization, and manipulation of materials at extremely small scales. This definition covers instrument parameter tuning, environmental conditioning, process execution, and quality verification at sub-micron resolution.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { operatePrecisionEquipmentControlMicroscopic } from '@headlessly/operate-precision-equipment-control-microscopic'

const nano = operatePrecisionEquipmentControlMicroscopic()

// Configure electron beam lithography
const config = await nano.configureInstrument({
  instrumentId: 'EBL-JEOL-9500',
  accelerationVoltage: 100,
  beamCurrent: 0.5,
  writeField: 500,
  resolutionNm: 5
})

// Execute patterning process
await nano.loadSubstrate({ instrumentId: 'EBL-JEOL-9500', substrateName: 'Si-100nm-PMMA' })
const run = await nano.executeProcess({
  instrumentId: 'EBL-JEOL-9500',
  recipeId: 'NANOWIRE-PATTERN-V3',
  doseUcPerCm2: 300
})

// Characterize results with SEM
const results = await nano.captureCharacterization({
  instrumentId: 'SEM-HITACHI-8200',
  fabricationRunId: run.id,
  magnification: 50000
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on environment drift
nano.environmentConditioned(async ({ cleanroomId, particleCount, threshold }) => {
  if (particleCount > threshold) {
    await notify({
      to: 'cleanroom-technician',
      message: `Particle count ${particleCount} exceeds limit in ${cleanroomId}`
    })
  }
})

// Save successful recipes automatically
nano.outcomeValidated(async ({ fabricationRunId, withinSpec, recipeId }) => {
  if (withinSpec) {
    await nano.saveRecipe({ recipeId, fabricationRunId, status: 'validated' })
  }
})
```
