## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { operateGroundsMaintenanceEquipment } from '@headlessly/operate-grounds-maintenance-equipment'

const grounds = operateGroundsMaintenanceEquipment()

// Assign an operator to a property
const assignment = await grounds.assignServiceArea({
  operatorId: 'op-martinez',
  serviceAreaId: 'corporate-campus-east',
  equipment: ['mower-ztr-72', 'trimmer-echo-225']
})

// Start a mowing task
await grounds.startMaintenanceTask({
  serviceAreaId: 'corporate-campus-east',
  taskType: 'mowing',
  mowingHeight: { inches: 3.5 }
})

// Complete and log the task
await grounds.completeMaintenanceTask({
  taskId: assignment.taskId,
  areaCovered: { acres: 8.2 },
  duration: { minutes: 135 }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Schedule blade sharpening after accumulated mowing hours
grounds.maintenanceTaskCompleted(async ({ equipmentIds, duration }) => {
  for (const equipmentId of equipmentIds) {
    const status = await grounds.getEquipmentStatus({ equipmentId })
    if (status.hoursSinceSharpening > 40) {
      await grounds.scheduleEquipmentService({
        equipmentId,
        serviceType: 'blade-sharpening'
      })
    }
  }
})

// Notify supervisor when equipment fails
grounds.equipmentFailureReported(async ({ equipmentId, operatorId, description }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'crew-supervisor',
    message: `Equipment ${equipmentId} failure reported by ${operatorId}: ${description}`
  })
})
```
