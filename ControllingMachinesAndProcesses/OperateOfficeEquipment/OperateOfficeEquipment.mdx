## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { operateOfficeEquipment } from '@headlessly/operate-office-equipment'

const office = operateOfficeEquipment()

// Submit a print job
const job = await office.submitPrintJob({
  deviceId: 'MFP-FLOOR3-01',
  documentPath: '/reports/quarterly-summary.pdf',
  copies: 10,
  color: true,
  duplex: true
})

// Initiate a document scan
await office.initiateScan({
  deviceId: 'SCN-RECEPTION-01',
  outputFormat: 'pdf',
  destination: '/scans/incoming-mail/',
  resolution: 300
})

// Replenish toner when low
await office.replenishSupplies({
  deviceId: 'MFP-FLOOR3-01',
  supplyType: 'toner-black',
  quantity: 2
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-order supplies when levels are low
office.supplyLevelLow(async ({ deviceId, supplyType, remainingPercent }) => {
  if (remainingPercent < 10) {
    await notify({
      to: 'office-admin',
      message: `${supplyType} on ${deviceId} at ${remainingPercent}% - reorder needed`
    })
  }
})

// Notify user when scan completes
office.scanJobCompleted(async ({ userId, documentPath, pageCount }) => {
  await notify({
    to: userId,
    message: `Scan complete: ${pageCount} pages saved to ${documentPath}`
  })
})
```
