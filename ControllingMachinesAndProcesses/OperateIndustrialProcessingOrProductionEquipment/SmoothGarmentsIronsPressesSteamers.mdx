# Smooth Garments Irons Presses Steamers

> Business-as-Code definition for garment smoothing with irons, presses, and steamers. Models the complete finishing workflow from garment intake through pressing, steaming, quality inspection, and preparation for packaging or display.

## Overview

Smoothing garments with irons, presses, or steamers involves operating heated pressing equipment, steam tunnels, and hand irons to remove wrinkles and creases from clothing and textile products. This includes selecting appropriate temperature and steam settings for different fabrics, managing batch throughput, and ensuring garments meet appearance standards. The definition covers both commercial laundry finishing and garment manufacturing pressing operations.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { smoothGarmentsIronsPressesSteamers } from '@headlessly/smooth-garments-irons-presses-steamers'

const pressing = smoothGarmentsIronsPressesSteamers()

// Sort incoming batch by fabric
const sorted = await pressing.sortGarmentsByFabric({
  orderId: 'FO-2240',
  garments: ['cotton-shirt-01', 'silk-blouse-02', 'wool-jacket-03']
})

// Configure for cotton group and press
await pressing.configurePressingProfile({
  fabricType: 'cotton',
  temperature: 200,
  steamLevel: 'high',
  pressure: 'medium'
})

await pressing.pressGarment({
  garmentId: 'cotton-shirt-01',
  duration: 15
})

// Inspect result
const result = await pressing.inspectFinishedGarment({
  garmentId: 'cotton-shirt-01'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-package after passing inspection
pressing.finishedGarmentInspected(async ({ garmentId, passed }) => {
  if (passed) {
    await pressing.packageFinishedGarment({ garmentId })
  }
})

// Alert on quality failures for delicate fabrics
pressing.finishedGarmentInspected(async ({ garmentId, passed, fabricType, defects }) => {
  if (!passed && ['silk', 'cashmere', 'linen'].includes(fabricType)) {
    await notify({
      to: 'finishing-supervisor',
      message: `Quality issue on delicate fabric ${fabricType} (${garmentId}): ${defects.join(', ')}`
    })
  }
})
```
