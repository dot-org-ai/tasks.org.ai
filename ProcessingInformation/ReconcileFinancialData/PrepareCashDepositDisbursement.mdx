## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { prepareCashDepositDisbursement } from '@headlessly/prepare-cash-deposit-disbursement'

const cashOps = prepareCashDepositDisbursement()

// Count and verify cash
const count = await cashOps.countCash({
  sourceId: 'register-04-shift-close',
  denominations: {
    hundreds: 12, fifties: 8, twenties: 45,
    tens: 22, fives: 30, ones: 88,
    quarters: 120, dimes: 200
  }
})

await cashOps.verifyAmount({
  countId: count.id,
  expectedTotal: 3247.50
})

// Package for deposit
await cashOps.packageDeposit({
  countId: count.id,
  depositSlipNumber: 'DS-2026-02-05-003',
  bankAccount: 'acct-7821'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Flag discrepancies over threshold
cashOps.discrepancyRecorded(async ({ countId, difference }) => {
  if (Math.abs(difference) > 50) {
    await notify({
      to: 'treasury-supervisor',
      message: `Cash discrepancy of $${difference} on count ${countId}`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-schedule pickup when deposit is packaged
cashOps.depositPackaged(async ({ packageId, amount }) => {
  if (amount > 10000) {
    await cashOps.schedulePickup({ packageId, carrier: 'brinks' })
  }
})
```
