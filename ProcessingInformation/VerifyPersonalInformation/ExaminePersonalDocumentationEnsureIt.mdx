## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { examinePersonalDocumentationEnsureIt } from '@headlessly/examine-personal-documentation-ensure-it'

const examiner = examinePersonalDocumentationEnsureIt()

// Submit a document for verification
const request = await examiner.submitDocument({
  holderId: 'applicant-chen-0042',
  documentType: 'drivers-license',
  issuingState: 'CA',
  documentNumber: 'D1234567',
  expirationDate: '2028-06-15'
})

// Authenticate and check
await examiner.authenticateDocument({ requestId: request.id })
await examiner.checkExpiration({ requestId: request.id })
await examiner.inspectForTampering({ requestId: request.id })

// Approve
await examiner.approveDocument({ requestId: request.id })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Escalate suspicious documents to security
examiner.suspiciousDocumentFlagged(async ({ requestId, holderId, indicators }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'security-team',
    message: `Suspicious document from ${holderId}: ${indicators.join(', ')}`
  })
})

// Track expiring documents for renewal reminders
examiner.documentApproved(async ({ holderId, documentType, expirationDate }) => {
  await scheduleReminder({
    holderId,
    type: documentType,
    reminderDate: daysBeforeExpiration(expirationDate, 90)
  })
})
```
