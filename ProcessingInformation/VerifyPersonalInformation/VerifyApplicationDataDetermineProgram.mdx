## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { verifyApplicationDataDetermineProgram } from '@headlessly/verify-application-data-determine-program'

const verifier = verifyApplicationDataDetermineProgram()

// Receive an application
const app = await verifier.receiveApplication({
  programId: 'medicaid-expansion-2026',
  applicantId: 'app-rivera-8821',
  householdSize: 4,
  annualIncome: 38000,
  documents: ['tax-return-2025', 'proof-of-residency']
})

// Check and validate
await verifier.checkCompleteness({ applicationId: app.id })
await verifier.validateDocuments({ applicationId: app.id })

// Determine eligibility
const decision = await verifier.matchCriteria({
  applicationId: app.id,
  criteria: { maxIncome: 42000, residencyRequired: true }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify applicant of decision
verifier.eligibilityApproved(async ({ applicationId, applicantId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: applicantId,
    message: 'Your application has been approved. Enrollment details will follow.'
  })
})

verifier.eligibilityDenied(async ({ applicationId, applicantId, reasons }) => {
  await notify({
    to: applicantId,
    message: `Your application was denied: ${reasons.join(', ')}. You may file an appeal.`
  })
})
```
