## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { verifyEmployeeInformation } from '@headlessly/verify-employee-information'

const verifier = verifyEmployeeInformation()

// Start verification for a new hire
const verification = await verifier.initiateVerification({
  employeeId: 'emp-new-2026-0412',
  name: 'Sarah Mitchell',
  checks: ['identity', 'work-authorization', 'employment-history', 'education']
})

// Validate identity and work authorization
await verifier.validateIdentity({ verificationId: verification.id })
await verifier.verifyWorkAuthorization({
  verificationId: verification.id,
  formType: 'I-9',
  documentA: 'us-passport'
})

// Check employment history
await verifier.checkEmploymentHistory({
  verificationId: verification.id,
  employers: [
    { name: 'Acme Corp', startDate: '2022-03-01', endDate: '2025-12-31' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Escalate unresolved discrepancies
verifier.discrepancyFlagged(async ({ verificationId, employeeId, field }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'hr-compliance',
    message: `Verification discrepancy for ${employeeId} on ${field}`
  })
})

// Auto-complete onboarding when all checks pass
verifier.outcomeDocumented(async ({ verificationId, allPassed }) => {
  if (allPassed) {
    await completeOnboarding({ verificationId })
  }
})
```
