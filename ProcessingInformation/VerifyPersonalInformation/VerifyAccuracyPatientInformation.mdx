# Verify Accuracy of Patient Information

> Business-as-Code definition for verifying patient information accuracy. Models the validation of demographics, insurance coverage, medical history, and consent records to ensure correct and safe healthcare delivery.

Verifying the accuracy of patient information involves confirming demographic details, insurance eligibility, medication lists, allergy records, and consent forms against authoritative sources before clinical encounters or administrative processing. This definition provides actions for data intake, cross-referencing with payer systems, identity matching, and discrepancy resolution. It supports medical registrars, nursing staff, billing departments, and health information management teams.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { verifyAccuracyPatientInformation } from '@headlessly/verify-accuracy-patient-information'

const verifier = verifyAccuracyPatientInformation()

// Collect patient data at check-in
const record = await verifier.collectPatientData({
  patientId: 'pt-thompson-4419',
  demographics: {
    name: 'James Thompson',
    dob: '1978-04-12',
    phone: '555-0142'
  },
  insuranceId: 'BCBS-IL-99281774'
})

// Verify demographics and insurance
await verifier.verifyDemographics({ recordId: record.id })
const insurance = await verifier.checkInsuranceEligibility({
  recordId: record.id,
  serviceDate: '2026-02-05'
})

// Reconcile medications
await verifier.reconcileMedications({
  recordId: record.id,
  reportedMedications: ['lisinopril-10mg', 'metformin-500mg']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert clinical staff on allergy discrepancies
verifier.discrepancyResolved(async ({ patientId, field, previousValue, newValue }) => {
  if (field === 'allergies') {
    await notify({
      to: 'clinical-team',
      message: `Allergy record updated for ${patientId}: ${previousValue} -> ${newValue}`
    })
  }
})

// Notify billing when insurance is confirmed
verifier.insuranceEligibilityChecked(async ({ patientId, eligible, copay }) => {
  if (eligible) {
    await notify({ to: 'billing', message: `Insurance confirmed for ${patientId}, copay: $${copay}` })
  }
})
```
