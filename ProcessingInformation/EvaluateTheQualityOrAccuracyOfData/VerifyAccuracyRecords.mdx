## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { verifyAccuracyRecords } from '@headlessly/verify-accuracy-records'

const records = verifyAccuracyRecords()

// Verify a business record
const verification = await records.verifyRecord({
  recordId: 'rec_2026_customer_001234',
  includeHistory: true
})

// Check retention compliance
const retention = await records.validateRetention({
  recordId: 'rec_2026_customer_001234',
  currentDate: '2026-01-15'
})

// Certify record accuracy
await records.certifyRecord({
  recordId: 'rec_2026_customer_001234',
  certifiedBy: 'compliance-officer',
  certificationDate: '2026-01-15'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-archive expired records
records.retentionValidated(async ({ recordId, status }) => {
  if (status === 'expired') {
    await records.archiveRecord({
      recordId,
      archiveDestination: 'long-term-storage'
    })
  }
})

// Notify on critical incomplete records
records.recordVerified(async ({ recordId, completeness, recordType }) => {
  if (completeness < 0.9 && recordType === 'regulatory-filing') {
    await notify({
      to: 'compliance-team',
      priority: 'high',
      message: `Critical record ${recordId} incomplete: ${completeness * 100}%`
    })
  }
})
```
