### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { reviewAccuracySalesTransactions } from '@headlessly/review-accuracy-sales-transactions'

const transactions = reviewAccuracySalesTransactions()

// Review a recent transaction
const review = await transactions.reviewTransaction({
  transactionId: 'txn_2026_001234',
  includeLineItems: true
})

// Validate pricing against catalog
const pricing = await transactions.validatePricing({
  transactionId: 'txn_2026_001234',
  catalogVersion: '2026-Q1'
})

// Reconcile payment to bank deposit
await transactions.reconcilePayment({

```typescript
// Auto-flag high-value discrepancies
transactions.discrepancyFlagged(async ({ transactionId, amount, type }) => {
  if (amount > 1000) {
    await notify({
      to: 'finance-team',
      priority: 'high',
      message: `${type} discrepancy of $${amount} on ${transactionId}`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-approve low-value transactions
transactions.transactionReviewed(async ({ transactionId, totalAmount }) => {
  if (totalAmount < 50 && review.discrepancies.length === 0) {
    await transactions.approveTransaction({ transactionId })
  }
})
```
