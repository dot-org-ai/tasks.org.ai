## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { createImagesVisualDisplays } from '@headlessly/create-images-visual-displays'

const visualDesign = createImagesVisualDisplays()

// Create a creative brief
const brief = await visualDesign.createBrief({
  client: 'Acme Corporation',
  project: 'Q2 Product Launch Campaign',
  deliverables: ['hero-banner', 'social-media-set', 'trade-show-backdrop'],
  dimensions: { heroBanner: '1920x1080', socialMedia: '1080x1080', backdrop: '10ft x 8ft' },
  brandGuidelines: 'acme-brand-guide-v3'
})

// Design the hero banner asset
const asset = await visualDesign.designAsset({
  briefId: brief.id,
  deliverable: 'hero-banner',
  tools: ['Adobe Photoshop', 'Adobe Illustrator'],
  sourceImages: ['product-photography-set-a']
})

// Prepare production files for all formats
await visualDesign.prepareProduction({
  assetId: asset.id,
  formats: [
    { type: 'web', format: 'PNG', resolution: '72dpi' },
    { type: 'print', format: 'PDF', resolution: '300dpi', colorSpace: 'CMYK' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify client when assets are delivered
visualDesign.assetDelivered(async ({ assetId, project, deliverable }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'client-stakeholders',
    message: `Visual asset "${deliverable}" for ${project} has been delivered`
  })
})

// Auto-create production files when design is approved
visualDesign.draftReviewed(async ({ assetId, decision, feedback }) => {
  if (decision === 'approved') {
    await visualDesign.prepareProduction({
      assetId,
      formats: [{ type: 'web', format: 'PNG' }, { type: 'print', format: 'PDF' }]
    })
  }
})
```
