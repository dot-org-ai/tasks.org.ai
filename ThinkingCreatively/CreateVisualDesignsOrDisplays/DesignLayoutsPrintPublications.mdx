## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { designLayoutsPrintPublications } from '@headlessly/design-layouts-print-publications'

const publications = designLayoutsPrintPublications()

// Review editorial brief
const brief = await publications.reviewBrief({
  publication: 'quarterly-design-review',
  issue: 'Spring-2026',
  pageCount: 96,
  trim: { width: 210, height: 280, unit: 'mm' },
  colorProfile: 'FOGRA39',
  binding: 'perfect-bound'
})

// Construct page grid
const grid = await publications.constructGrid({
  briefId: brief.id,
  columns: 5,
  gutter: 4.5,
  margins: { top: 18, bottom: 22, inside: 20, outside: 15 },
  baselineGrid: 12,
  unit: 'pt'
})

// Compose spreads
await publications.composeSpreads({
  briefId: brief.id,
  gridId: grid.id,
  spreads: [
    { pages: [4, 5], type: 'feature-opener', headline: true, fullBleedImage: true },
    { pages: [6, 7], type: 'body-text', columns: 3, pullQuote: true },
    { pages: [8, 9], type: 'photo-essay', imageCount: 6, captioned: true }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify print vendor when prepress files are ready
publications.prepressFilesReady(async ({ publicationId, issue, pageCount }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'print-vendor',
    message: `Prepress files for ${issue} ready - ${pageCount} pages - awaiting press proof`
  })
})

// Auto-style typography after spreads are composed
publications.spreadsComposed(async ({ publicationId, spreadCount }) => {
  await publications.styleTypography({
    publicationId,
    stylesheet: 'quarterly-design-review-v3',
    openTypeFeatures: ['ligatures', 'oldstyle-figures', 'small-caps']
  })
})
```
