# Design Alternative Energy Systems

> Business-as-Code definition for designing alternative energy systems including geothermal heat pumps, biomass generators, hydrogen fuel cells, tidal power installations, and hybrid renewable microgrids.

## Overview

Alternative energy system design involves evaluating non-conventional energy sources, engineering conversion technologies, modeling system output, and integrating these systems into existing infrastructure. This definition models the process from resource assessment through technology selection, system engineering, environmental impact review, and commissioning planning.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { designAlternativeEnergySystems } from '@headlessly/design-alternative-energy-systems'

const altEnergy = designAlternativeEnergySystems()

// Survey the resource
const resource = await altEnergy.surveyResource({
  site: { lat: 46.8, lng: -121.7 },
  resources: ['geothermal', 'biomass', 'small-hydro'],
  dataCollection: { duration: 12, unit: 'months' }
})

// Select technology
const tech = await altEnergy.selectTechnology({
  resourceId: resource.id,
  candidates: [
    { type: 'binary-cycle-geothermal', capacity: 5, unit: 'MW' },
    { type: 'biomass-gasification', capacity: 2, unit: 'MW' },
    { type: 'run-of-river-hydro', capacity: 1.5, unit: 'MW' }
  ],
  criteria: ['LCOE', 'environmental-impact', 'reliability']
})

// Engineer the system
await altEnergy.engineerSystem({
  technologyId: tech.id,
  components: ['wellhead-equipment', 'binary-turbine', 'air-cooled-condenser', 'power-block'],
  designLife: 30
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify developer when environmental review passes
altEnergy.environmentalImpactAssessed(async ({ projectId, approved }) => {
  if (approved) {
    await notify({
      to: 'energy-developer',
      message: `Environmental impact approved for project ${projectId} - proceeding to output modeling`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-plan commissioning after interconnection design
altEnergy.interconnectionDesigned(async ({ projectId }) => {
  await altEnergy.planCommissioning({ projectId })
})
```
