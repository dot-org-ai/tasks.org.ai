# Design Energy-efficient Vehicles or Vehicle Components

> Business-as-Code definition for designing energy-efficient vehicles and components including electric drivetrains, lightweight structures, aerodynamic bodies, regenerative braking systems, and battery management modules.

## Overview

Energy-efficient vehicle design involves optimizing powertrain efficiency, reducing vehicle mass, improving aerodynamics, and integrating energy recovery systems to minimize fuel or electricity consumption per mile traveled. This definition models the process from efficiency target setting through component design, simulation, prototype testing, and regulatory certification.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { designEnergyEfficientVehiclesVehicleComponents } from '@headlessly/design-energy-efficient-vehicles-vehicle-components'

const vehicle = designEnergyEfficientVehiclesVehicleComponents()

// Set efficiency targets
const targets = await vehicle.setEfficiencyTargets({
  vehicleClass: 'midsize-sedan',
  powertrain: 'battery-electric',
  range: { value: 350, unit: 'miles' },
  efficiency: { value: 3.5, unit: 'miles-per-kWh' },
  standard: 'EPA-combined-cycle'
})

// Design powertrain
const powertrain = await vehicle.designPowertrain({
  targetsId: targets.id,
  motor: { type: 'permanent-magnet-synchronous', peakPower: 200, unit: 'kW' },
  inverter: { efficiency: 0.97 },
  transmission: 'single-speed-reduction'
})

// Optimize aerodynamics
await vehicle.optimizeAerodynamics({
  powertrainId: powertrain.id,
  targetCd: 0.22,
  features: ['active-grille-shutters', 'flush-door-handles', 'boat-tail-rear', 'underbody-paneling']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify certification team when simulation meets targets
vehicle.driveCycleSimulated(async ({ designId, meetsTarget, efficiency }) => {
  if (meetsTarget) {
    await notify({
      to: 'certification-team',
      message: `Design ${designId} achieves ${efficiency} mi/kWh - ready for regulatory certification`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-simulate after battery design completion
vehicle.batterySystemDesigned(async ({ designId }) => {
  await vehicle.simulateDriveCycle({ designId })
})
```
