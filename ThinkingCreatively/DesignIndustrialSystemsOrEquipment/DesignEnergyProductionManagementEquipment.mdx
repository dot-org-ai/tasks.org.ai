# Design Energy Production or Management Equipment

> Business-as-Code definition for designing energy production and management equipment including turbines, solar arrays, battery storage systems, grid interconnection hardware, and power distribution infrastructure.

## Overview

Energy equipment design involves engineering systems that generate, convert, store, or distribute electrical and thermal energy from conventional and renewable sources. This definition models the workflow from resource assessment and system sizing through component selection, electrical design, grid integration engineering, and commissioning documentation.

## Actors

| Actor | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| UtilityOperator | Power company or independent producer commissioning the system |
| TurbineManufacturer | Vendor fabricating generation turbines or engines |
| BatterySupplier | Provider of energy storage cells and management systems |
| GridOperator | Transmission authority managing interconnection requirements |
| EnvironmentalAgency | Regulator assessing environmental impact of energy projects |
| InverterManufacturer | Vendor supplying power conversion equipment |

## Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| PowerSystemsEngineer | Designs generation and distribution systems |
| ElectricalDesigner | Develops single-line diagrams and protective relay schemes |
| EnergyAnalyst | Models resource availability and system performance |
| CommissioningEngineer | Validates installed systems against design specifications |

## Entities

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ResourceAssessment | Analysis of solar irradiance, wind speed, or fuel availability |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { designEnergyProductionManagementEquipment } from '@headlessly/design-energy-production-management-equipment'

const energy = designEnergyProductionManagementEquipment()

// Assess the resource
const resource = await energy.assessResource({
  site: { lat: 35.0, lng: -118.0 },
  technology: 'solar-PV',
  dataSource: 'NSRDB-TMY3',
  years: 25
})

// Size the system
const sizing = await energy.sizeSystem({
  resourceId: resource.id,
  targetCapacity: { value: 100, unit: 'MW-AC' },
  storageHours: 4,
  dcAcRatio: 1.3,
  degradationRate: 0.005
})

// Design electrical systems
await energy.designElectrical({
  sizingId: sizing.id,
  voltage: { collection: '34.5kV', pointOfInterconnection: '230kV' },
  protection: ['overcurrent', 'ground-fault', 'anti-islanding'],
  inverterType: 'central-2500kVA'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify utility when interconnection design is complete
energy.interconnectionEngineered(async ({ projectId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'grid-operator',
    message: `Interconnection engineering complete for project ${projectId} - ready for review`
  })
})

// Auto-model performance after equipment selection
energy.equipmentSelected(async ({ projectId }) => {
  await energy.modelPerformance({ projectId })
})
```
