# Incorporate Green Features into the Design of Structures or Facilities

> Business-as-Code definition for integrating sustainable design elements such as energy efficiency, renewable materials, water conservation, and indoor environmental quality into building and facility designs.

## Overview

Green feature incorporation involves evaluating sustainable design options, modeling energy performance, selecting eco-friendly materials, and pursuing green building certifications. This definition covers the process of identifying applicable sustainability strategies, integrating them into architectural and engineering designs, performing lifecycle cost analysis, and documenting compliance with green building standards such as LEED and WELL.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { incorporateGreenFeaturesIntoDesign } from '@headlessly/incorporate-green-features-into-design'

const greenDesign = incorporateGreenFeaturesIntoDesign()

// Assess sustainability options
const options = await greenDesign.assessSustainabilityOptions({
  projectType: 'commercial-office',
  location: 'Austin, TX',
  targetCertification: 'LEED-Gold',
  categories: ['energy', 'water', 'materials', 'indoor-quality']
})

// Model energy performance
const energyModel = await greenDesign.modelEnergyPerformance({
  projectId: options.projectId,
  features: [
    { type: 'solar-panels', capacity: 200, unit: 'kW' },
    { type: 'high-performance-glazing', uValue: 0.25 },
    { type: 'variable-refrigerant-flow', cop: 4.2 }
  ],
  baselineCode: 'ASHRAE-90.1-2019'
})

// Conduct lifecycle analysis
await greenDesign.conductLifecycleAnalysis({
  projectId: options.projectId,
  horizon: 30,
  discountRate: 0.03
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify team when energy model shows significant savings
greenDesign.energyPerformanceModeled(async ({ projectId, savingsPercent }) => {
  if (savingsPercent > 30) {
    await notify({
      to: 'design-team',
      message: `Energy model shows ${savingsPercent}% savings over baseline for project ${projectId}`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-apply for certification when lifecycle analysis is favorable
greenDesign.lifecycleAnalysisCompleted(async ({ projectId, roi }) => {
  if (roi > 0) {
    await greenDesign.applyCertification({ projectId })
  }
})
```
