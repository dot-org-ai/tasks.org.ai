# Design Micro- or Nano-scale Materials, Devices, or Systems

> Business-as-Code definition for designing materials, devices, and systems at micro- and nano-scale dimensions, including MEMS sensors, nanocomposites, lab-on-a-chip platforms, and quantum dot arrays.

## Overview

Micro- and nano-scale design involves engineering structures at dimensions from nanometers to hundreds of micrometers, requiring cleanroom fabrication processes, atomic-level material characterization, and specialized simulation tools. This definition models the workflow from concept feasibility through device modeling, mask layout, fabrication process development, and characterization validation.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { designMicroNanoScaleMaterialsDevices } from '@headlessly/design-micro-nano-scale-materials-devices'

const nanoDesign = designMicroNanoScaleMaterialsDevices()

// Assess feasibility of a MEMS pressure sensor
const feasibility = await nanoDesign.assessFeasibility({
  deviceType: 'piezoresistive-pressure-sensor',
  featureSize: { min: 2, unit: 'um' },
  substrate: 'SOI-wafer',
  targetSensitivity: { value: 0.5, unit: 'mV/kPa' }
})

// Simulate device behavior
const sim = await nanoDesign.simulateDevice({
  conceptId: feasibility.id,
  method: 'finite-element-analysis',
  parameters: {
    diaphragmThickness: 10,
    diaphragmDiameter: 500,
    unit: 'um',
    pressureRange: { min: 0, max: 500, unit: 'kPa' }
  }
})

// Design mask layout
await nanoDesign.designMaskLayout({
  simulationId: sim.id,
  layers: ['silicon-etch', 'oxide-deposition', 'metal-contact', 'passivation'],
  dieSize: { width: 2, height: 2, unit: 'mm' }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Trigger fabrication when mask layout is complete
nanoDesign.maskLayoutDesigned(async ({ designId }) => {
  await nanoDesign.developProcessFlow({ designId })
})

// Notify research team when characterization is complete
nanoDesign.devicesCharacterized(async ({ designId, yield: deviceYield }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'research-team',
    message: `Device ${designId} characterization complete - wafer yield: ${deviceYield}%`
  })
})
```
