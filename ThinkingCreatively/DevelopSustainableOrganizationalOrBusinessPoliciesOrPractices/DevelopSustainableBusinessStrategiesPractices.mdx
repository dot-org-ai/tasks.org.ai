## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { developSustainableBusinessStrategiesPractices } from '@headlessly/develop-sustainable-business-strategies-practices'

const strategies = developSustainableBusinessStrategiesPractices()

// Assess current ESG position
const baseline = await strategies.assessESGPosition({
  frameworks: ['GRI', 'TCFD', 'CDP'],
  reportingYear: 2025,
  scopes: ['scope1', 'scope2', 'scope3']
})

// Formulate strategy with carbon targets
const strategy = await strategies.formulateStrategy({
  timeHorizon: { start: '2026-01-01', end: '2030-12-31' },
  pillars: ['carbonReduction', 'circularEconomy', 'socialEquity'],
  alignedSDGs: [7, 12, 13]
})

await strategies.setCarbonTargets({
  strategyId: strategy.id,
  targets: [
    { scope: 'scope1', reduction: 0.50, baselineYear: 2025, targetYear: 2030 },
    { scope: 'scope2', reduction: 0.75, baselineYear: 2025, targetYear: 2030 }
  ],
  scienceBasedTarget: true
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify investors when sustainability report is published
strategies.reportPublished(async ({ reportId, reportingYear, highlights }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'investor-relations',
    message: `${reportingYear} Sustainability Report published with ${highlights.length} key achievements`
  })
})

// Alert leadership when ESG scores decline
strategies.esgAssessed(async ({ scores, priorScores }) => {
  const declining = Object.keys(scores).filter(k => scores[k] < priorScores[k])
  if (declining.length > 0) {
    await escalate({
      to: 'executive-team',
      subject: `ESG score decline in: ${declining.join(', ')}`
    })
  }
})
```
