# Develop Sustainable Industrial Development Methods

> Business-as-Code definition for developing industrial production and development methods that minimize environmental impact and promote resource efficiency.

## Overview

Developing sustainable industrial or development methods involves redesigning manufacturing processes, construction techniques, and industrial operations to reduce energy consumption, minimize waste, and lower emissions. Engineers and sustainability professionals evaluate current methods, identify cleaner technologies, and implement process improvements that maintain productivity while advancing environmental performance. This work spans sectors including manufacturing, construction, energy production, and materials processing.

## Actors

| Actor | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| EnvironmentalRegulator | Enforces emissions standards and industrial environmental permits |
| TechnologyVendor | Supplies cleaner production equipment and process technologies |
| MaterialsSupplier | Provides sustainable raw materials and recycled feedstocks |
| IndustryConsortium | Collaborates on sector-wide sustainable development standards |
| CommunityGroup | Represents local populations affected by industrial operations |
| ResearchInstitution | Develops and validates new sustainable industrial technologies |

## Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ProcessEngineer | Designs and optimizes sustainable industrial methods |
| SustainabilityEngineer | Evaluates environmental performance and identifies improvement areas |
| PlantManager | Oversees implementation of sustainable methods in production facilities |
| EnvironmentalCompliance Specialist | Ensures industrial methods meet regulatory requirements |

## Entities

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| IndustrialMethod | A production or development process with defined inputs and outputs |
| EnvironmentalImpactAssessment | Quantified evaluation of a method's ecological footprint |
| ProcessImprovement | A specific change to reduce waste, energy, or emissions |
| CleanTechnology | Equipment or technique that reduces environmental impact |
| ResourceEfficiencyMetric | Measure of material or energy utilization effectiveness |
| PilotProject | A small-scale trial of a sustainable method before full rollout |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { developSustainableIndustrialDevelopmentMethods } from '@headlessly/develop-sustainable-industrial-development-methods'

const methods = developSustainableIndustrialDevelopmentMethods()

// Audit current manufacturing processes
const audit = await methods.auditCurrentMethods({
  facilityId: 'plant-chicago-01',
  processes: ['thermalCuring', 'solventCleaning', 'wasteDisposal'],
  metrics: ['energyPerUnit', 'waterPerUnit', 'emissionsPerUnit']
})

// Design a sustainable alternative
const process = await methods.designSustainableProcess({
  replacesMethod: 'solventCleaning',
  newMethod: 'aqueousUltrasonicCleaning',
  expectedImprovements: {
    vocEmissions: { reduction: 0.95 },
    energyConsumption: { reduction: 0.30 },
    waterRecycleRate: 0.85
  }
})

// Run pilot and validate
const pilot = await methods.conductPilot({
  processId: process.id,
  facilityId: 'plant-chicago-01',
  duration: { weeks: 8 },
  productionVolume: 5000
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify plant manager when pilot results are ready
methods.resultsValidated(async ({ processId, pilot, outcomes }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'plant-manager',
    message: `Pilot for process ${processId} complete: ${outcomes.energyReduction}% energy reduction achieved`
  })
})

// Schedule full deployment after successful validation
methods.methodDeployed(async ({ processId, facilityId }) => {
  await createTask({
    assignee: 'environmental-compliance',
    description: `Update permits and monitoring plans for new process at ${facilityId}`,
    dueDate: addWeeks(new Date(), 4)
  })
})
```
