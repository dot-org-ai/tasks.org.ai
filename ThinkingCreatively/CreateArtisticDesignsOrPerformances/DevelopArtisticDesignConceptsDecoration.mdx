# Develop Artistic or Design Concepts for Decoration, Exhibition, or Commercial Purposes

> Business-as-Code definition for developing artistic and design concepts used in interior decoration, exhibition design, commercial branding environments, and visual merchandising that shape spatial experiences and brand narratives.

## Overview

Artistic concept development for decorative and commercial purposes involves synthesizing client vision, spatial constraints, cultural context, and brand identity into cohesive design directions that guide material selection, color palettes, furniture specification, and decorative detailing. This definition models the workflow from creative research through concept presentation, design development, specification, and handoff to fabrication and installation teams.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { developArtisticDesignConceptsDecoration } from '@headlessly/develop-artistic-design-concepts-decoration'

const concepts = developArtisticDesignConceptsDecoration()

// Conduct research
const research = await concepts.conductResearch({
  project: 'boutique-hotel-lobby',
  client: 'maison-veritas',
  context: {
    location: 'Paris-Marais-district',
    era: 'contemporary-with-Art-Deco-references',
    audience: 'luxury-traveler',
    squareMeters: 280
  },
  references: ['1920s-Parisian-salons', 'contemporary-Japanese-minimalism', 'biophilic-design']
})

// Assemble mood board
const moodBoard = await concepts.assembleMoodBoard({
  researchId: research.id,
  themes: ['gilded-restraint', 'natural-stone-textures', 'velvet-and-brass'],
  imageCount: 24,
  materialSwatches: 8
})

// Define color scheme
await concepts.defineColorScheme({
  projectId: research.projectId,
  palette: {
    primary: { name: 'warm-ivory', hex: '#F5F0E8' },
    secondary: { name: 'deep-forest', hex: '#2C3E2D' },
    accent: { name: 'antiqued-gold', hex: '#C5A55A' },
    neutral: { name: 'warm-grey', hex: '#9B9590' }
  },
  application: {
    walls: 'warm-ivory',
    upholstery: 'deep-forest',
    metalwork: 'antiqued-gold',
    flooring: 'natural-honed-limestone'
  }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify contractor when design package is delivered
concepts.designPackageDelivered(async ({ projectId, client }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'construction-contractor',
    message: `Design package for ${client} project ${projectId} delivered - ready for buildout scheduling`
  })
})

// Auto-specify materials after concept is approved
concepts.conceptPresented(async ({ projectId, approved }) => {
  if (approved) {
    await concepts.specifyMaterials({
      projectId,
      categories: ['wall-finishes', 'flooring', 'upholstery', 'metalwork', 'stone'],
      sampleRequired: true
    })
  }
})
```
