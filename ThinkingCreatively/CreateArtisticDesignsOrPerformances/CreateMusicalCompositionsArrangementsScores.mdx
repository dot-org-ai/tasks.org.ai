# Create Musical Compositions Arrangements Scores

> Business-as-Code definition for creating musical compositions, arrangements, and scores. Models the creative workflow from ideation through composition, orchestration, notation, and final score preparation.

## Overview

Creating musical compositions, arrangements, and scores involves developing original melodies, harmonies, and rhythmic structures or adapting existing works for different ensembles and contexts. This includes composing for film, television, theater, recordings, live performances, and commercial media. This definition exposes actions for drafting themes, arranging instrumentation, notating parts, producing demo recordings, and delivering final scores. Events enable automated tracking of revision cycles, and searches provide access to score libraries and instrumentation catalogs.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { createMusicalCompositionsArrangementsScores } from '@headlessly/create-musical-compositions-arrangements-scores'

const music = createMusicalCompositionsArrangementsScores()

// Compose a theme for a film score
const theme = await music.composeTheme({
  title: 'Rising Dawn',
  project: 'Feature Film - Horizon',
  genre: 'orchestral',
  tempo: 72,
  key: 'D major',
  duration: { value: 3, unit: 'minutes' }
})

// Arrange for a full orchestra
const arrangement = await music.arrangeForEnsemble({
  compositionId: theme.id,
  ensemble: 'full-orchestra',
  sections: ['strings', 'woodwinds', 'brass', 'percussion', 'harp']
})

// Notate and extract parts
await music.notateScore({
  compositionId: theme.id,
  arrangementId: arrangement.id,
  format: 'MusicXML'
})

const parts = await music.extractParts({
  compositionId: theme.id,
  arrangementId: arrangement.id,
  format: 'pdf'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify client when demo recording is ready for review
music.demoRecorded(async ({ compositionId, title, audioUrl }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'commissioning-client',
    message: `Demo recording of "${title}" is ready for review`,
    attachments: [audioUrl]
  })
})

// Auto-extract parts when score notation is complete
music.scoreNotated(async ({ compositionId, arrangementId }) => {
  await music.extractParts({
    compositionId,
    arrangementId,
    format: 'pdf'
  })
})
```
