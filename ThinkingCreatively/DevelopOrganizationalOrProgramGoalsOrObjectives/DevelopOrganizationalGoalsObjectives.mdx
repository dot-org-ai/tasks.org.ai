## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { developOrganizationalGoalsObjectives } from '@headlessly/develop-organizational-goals-objectives'

const strategy = developOrganizationalGoalsObjectives()

// Conduct environmental scan
const scan = await strategy.conductEnvironmentalScan({
  scope: 'enterprise',
  frameworks: ['SWOT', 'PESTLE'],
  period: 'FY2026'
})

// Define an organizational goal
const goal = await strategy.defineOrganizationalGoal({
  scanId: scan.id,
  title: 'Achieve market leadership in APAC region',
  timeframe: { start: '2026-01-01', end: '2028-12-31' },
  priority: 'critical'
})

// Set key results
await strategy.setKeyResults({
  goalId: goal.id,
  keyResults: [
    { description: 'Grow APAC revenue to $50M', target: 50000000 },
    { description: 'Establish partnerships in 5 new markets', target: 5 },
    { description: 'Achieve 30% brand awareness', target: 0.30 }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify leadership when goals are cascaded
strategy.goalsCascaded(async ({ goalId, units }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'executive-team',
    message: `Goal ${goalId} cascaded to ${units.length} business units`
  })
})

// Trigger realignment review when progress is off track
strategy.goalProgressReviewed(async ({ goalId, status, variance }) => {
  if (status === 'behind' && variance > 0.15) {
    await scheduleReview({
      goalId,
      type: 'realignment',
      urgency: 'high'
    })
  }
})
```
