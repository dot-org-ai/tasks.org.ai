## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { designPublicEmployeeHealthPrograms } from '@headlessly/design-public-employee-health-programs'

const wellness = designPublicEmployeeHealthPrograms()

// Assess workforce health risks
const risks = await wellness.assessWorkforceRisks({
  employer: 'manufacturing-corp',
  employees: 2500,
  methods: ['health-risk-questionnaire', 'biometric-screening', 'claims-analysis'],
  period: { year: 2024 }
})

// Design wellness program
const program = await wellness.designWellnessProgram({
  riskAssessmentId: risks.id,
  components: [
    { type: 'biometric-screening', frequency: 'annual' },
    { type: 'tobacco-cessation', modality: 'coaching-plus-NRT' },
    { type: 'diabetes-prevention', modality: 'CDC-DPP-lifestyle-change' },
    { type: 'ergonomics-assessment', setting: 'production-floor' }
  ],
  budget: { perEmployee: 350, currency: 'USD' }
})

// Structure incentive program
await wellness.structureIncentives({
  programId: program.id,
  incentives: [
    { activity: 'biometric-screening', reward: 150, type: 'premium-reduction' },
    { activity: 'health-coaching-completion', reward: 100, type: 'HSA-contribution' },
    { activity: 'fitness-milestone', reward: 50, type: 'gift-card' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert benefits team when risks indicate program design changes
wellness.workforceRisksAssessed(async ({ employerId, topRisks }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'benefits-analyst',
    message: `Workforce risk assessment complete for ${employerId} - top risks: ${topRisks.join(', ')}`
  })
})

// Auto-generate outcomes report after measurement period
wellness.outcomesMeasured(async ({ programId, roi, participationRate }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'hr-leadership',
    message: `Wellness program ${programId}: ${participationRate}% participation, ${roi}:1 ROI - annual review ready`
  })
})
```
