# Plan Programs to Address Community Health Issues

> Business-as-Code definition for planning community health programs including disease prevention campaigns, maternal and child health initiatives, chronic disease management, immunization outreach, and health equity interventions.

## Overview

Community health program planning involves analyzing population health data, identifying health disparities, designing culturally appropriate interventions, mobilizing community partnerships, and establishing surveillance systems to measure outcomes. This definition models the process from community health assessment through priority setting, program design, resource mobilization, and impact evaluation.

## Actors

| Actor | Description |

| LocalHealthDepartment | Government agency responsible for population health services |
| CommunityHealthCenter | Federally qualified health center providing primary care access |
| HospitalSystem | Regional hospital contributing community benefit programs |
| CommunityBasedOrganization | Nonprofit delivering culturally tailored health services |
| CDCRegionalOffice | Federal agency providing epidemiological guidance and funding |

## Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| PublicHealthPlanner | Designs population health interventions based on data |
| CommunityHealthEducator | Develops outreach and behavior change campaigns |
| Epidemiologist | Analyzes disease burden, risk factors, and health disparities |
| ProgramEvaluator | Measures intervention effectiveness and health outcomes |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { planProgramsAddressCommunityHealth } from '@headlessly/plan-programs-address-community-health'

const communityHealth = planProgramsAddressCommunityHealth()

// Conduct community health assessment
const assessment = await communityHealth.conductHealthAssessment({
  jurisdiction: 'metro-county',
  dataSources: ['vital-statistics', 'BRFSS', 'hospital-discharge', 'census-ACS'],
  indicators: ['diabetes-prevalence', 'infant-mortality', 'vaccination-rates', 'food-insecurity'],
  period: { years: 3 }
})

// Rank health priorities
const priorities = await communityHealth.rankHealthPriorities({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  criteria: ['magnitude', 'severity', 'health-equity-gap', 'intervention-feasibility'],
  method: 'Hanlon-prioritization'
})

// Design intervention for top priority
await communityHealth.designIntervention({
  priorityId: priorities.items[0].id,
  strategy: 'diabetes-prevention-program',
  targetPopulation: 'adults-with-prediabetes',
  setting: 'community-health-center',
  evidenceBase: 'CDC-National-DPP',
  duration: { months: 12 }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert partners when health assessment reveals disparities
communityHealth.healthAssessmentCompleted(async ({ jurisdictionId, disparities }) => {
  if (disparities.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'community-health-coalition',
      message: `${disparities.length} health disparities identified in ${jurisdictionId} - priority setting meeting needed`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-schedule evaluation after surveillance period
communityHealth.surveillanceImplemented(async ({ programId, reviewDate }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'program-evaluator',
    message: `Surveillance active for program ${programId} - impact evaluation scheduled for ${reviewDate}`
  })
})
```
