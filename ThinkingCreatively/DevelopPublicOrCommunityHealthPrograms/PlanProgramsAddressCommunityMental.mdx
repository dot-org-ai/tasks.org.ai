## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { planProgramsAddressCommunityMental } from '@headlessly/plan-programs-address-community-mental'

const mentalWellness = planProgramsAddressCommunityMental()

// Assess community mental health needs
const needs = await mentalWellness.assessMentalHealthNeeds({
  community: 'rural-appalachian-county',
  populations: ['adolescents', 'veterans', 'opioid-use-disorder'],
  dataSources: ['BRFSS', 'NSDUH', 'emergency-department-records'],
  period: { year: 2024 }
})

// Design intervention program
const program = await mentalWellness.designIntervention({
  needsAssessmentId: needs.id,
  modalities: [
    { type: 'cognitive-behavioral-therapy', setting: 'school-based', population: 'adolescents' },
    { type: 'medication-assisted-treatment', setting: 'outpatient', population: 'opioid-use-disorder' },
    { type: 'trauma-focused-cbt', setting: 'telehealth', population: 'veterans' }
  ],
  evidenceBase: 'SAMHSA-NREPP'
})

// Build peer support network
await mentalWellness.buildPeerNetwork({
  programId: program.id,
  specialists: 12,
  certificationStandard: 'state-peer-specialist',
  trainingHours: 75
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert clinical director when needs assessment reveals critical gaps
mentalWellness.mentalHealthNeedsAssessed(async ({ communityId, criticalGaps }) => {
  if (criticalGaps.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'clinical-program-director',
      message: `${criticalGaps.length} critical service gaps identified in ${communityId} - intervention design needed`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-submit outcome reports after metrics are established
mentalWellness.outcomeMetricsEstablished(async ({ programId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'state-substance-abuse-authority',
    message: `Program ${programId} outcome measurement framework active - quarterly reporting scheduled`
  })
})
```
