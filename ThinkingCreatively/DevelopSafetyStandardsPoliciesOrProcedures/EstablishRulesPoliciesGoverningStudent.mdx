## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { establishRulesPoliciesGoverningStudent } from '@headlessly/establish-rules-policies-governing-student'

const studentPolicy = establishRulesPoliciesGoverningStudent()

// Draft a new conduct policy
const policy = await studentPolicy.draftConductPolicy({
  name: 'Digital Device Usage Policy',
  category: 'Technology',
  scope: 'All Students K-12',
  effectiveDate: '2026-08-15',
  provisions: [
    { rule: 'Personal devices must remain off during instructional time', consequence: 'Device confiscation for remainder of day' },
    { rule: 'No recording of students or staff without consent', consequence: 'Suspension pending review' }
  ]
})

// Review for regulatory compliance
await studentPolicy.reviewPolicyCompliance({
  policyId: policy.id,
  standards: ['state-education-code', 'FERPA', 'district-guidelines']
})

// Record an incident
await studentPolicy.recordBehavioralIncident({
  studentId: 'stu-456',
  policyId: policy.id,
  description: 'Student used phone during exam period',
  severity: 'minor',
  witnesses: ['teacher-jones']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify parents when disciplinary action is issued
studentPolicy.disciplinaryActionIssued(async ({ studentId, action }) => {
  const parent = await getParentContact(studentId)
  await notify({
    to: parent.email,
    message: `Disciplinary action issued: ${action.type} - ${action.description}`
  })
})

// Flag patterns for administrative review
studentPolicy.behavioralTrendsAnalyzed(async ({ period, trends }) => {
  if (trends.repeatOffenders.length > 10) {
    await notify({
      to: 'dean-of-students',
      message: `${trends.repeatOffenders.length} repeat offenders identified in ${period} - policy review recommended`
    })
  }
})
```
