## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { developEducationalPrograms } from '@headlessly/develop-educational-programs'

const programs = developEducationalPrograms()

// Conduct market analysis
const market = await programs.conductMarketAnalysis({
  discipline: 'cybersecurity',
  level: 'masters',
  region: 'midwest',
  competitors: 5,
  employmentProjection: 'BLS-SOC-15-1212'
})

// Design curriculum
const curriculum = await programs.designCurriculum({
  proposalId: market.proposalId,
  credits: 36,
  courses: [
    { title: 'Network Security Fundamentals', credits: 3, semester: 1 },
    { title: 'Cryptography and Secure Communications', credits: 3, semester: 1 },
    { title: 'Incident Response and Forensics', credits: 3, semester: 2 },
    { title: 'Capstone: Security Architecture Design', credits: 6, semester: 4 }
  ],
  prerequisites: ['undergraduate-CS-or-IT']
})

// Plan resources
await programs.planResources({
  curriculumId: curriculum.id,
  faculty: { fullTime: 3, adjunct: 4 },
  facilities: ['cyber-lab', 'simulation-range'],
  annualBudget: 850000
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify marketing when program is accredited
programs.programLaunched(async ({ programId, discipline }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'enrollment-marketing',
    message: `${discipline} program ${programId} is live - begin recruitment campaign`
  })
})

// Alert leadership when governance review completes
programs.governanceApproved(async ({ programId }) => {
  await programs.submitAccreditation({ programId })
})
```
