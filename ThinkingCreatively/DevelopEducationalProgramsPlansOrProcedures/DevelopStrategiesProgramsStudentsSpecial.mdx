## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { developStrategiesProgramsStudentsSpecial } from '@headlessly/develop-strategies-programs-students-special'

const specialEd = developStrategiesProgramsStudentsSpecial()

// Evaluate eligibility
const evaluation = await specialEd.evaluateEligibility({
  studentId: 'STU-2026-0442',
  assessments: ['cognitive-ability', 'academic-achievement', 'behavioral-observation'],
  category: 'specific-learning-disability'
})

// Develop IEP
const iep = await specialEd.developIEP({
  evaluationId: evaluation.id,
  annualGoals: [
    { area: 'reading-fluency', baseline: 65, target: 110, metric: 'words-per-minute' },
    { area: 'math-computation', baseline: 'grade-2', target: 'grade-4', metric: 'grade-equivalent' }
  ],
  services: [
    { type: 'specialized-instruction', hours: 5, frequency: 'weekly' },
    { type: 'speech-therapy', hours: 1, frequency: 'weekly' }
  ]
})

// Design accommodations
await specialEd.designAccommodations({
  iepId: iep.id,
  accommodations: [
    { type: 'extended-time', percentage: 50, applies: 'assessments' },
    { type: 'text-to-speech', applies: 'reading-assignments' },
    { type: 'preferential-seating', location: 'front-row' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert team when progress monitoring shows insufficient growth
specialEd.progressMonitored(async ({ studentId, goal, growthRate }) => {
  if (growthRate < 0.5) {
    await notify({
      to: 'iep-team',
      message: `Student ${studentId} showing insufficient growth on ${goal} - IEP review recommended`
    })
  }
})

// Schedule annual IEP review
specialEd.iepDeveloped(async ({ iepId, studentId }) => {
  await scheduleReminder({
    date: addMonths(new Date(), 12),
    to: 'iep-coordinator',
    message: `Annual IEP review due for student ${studentId} - IEP ${iepId}`
  })
})
```
