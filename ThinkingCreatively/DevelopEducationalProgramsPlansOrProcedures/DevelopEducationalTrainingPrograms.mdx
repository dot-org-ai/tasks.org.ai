# Develop Educational or Training Programs

> Business-as-Code definition for developing corporate and professional training programs including onboarding, skills development, compliance training, and leadership development initiatives.

## Overview

Training program development involves identifying skill gaps, designing learning pathways, creating instructional content, selecting delivery modalities, and measuring return on investment for workforce development initiatives. This definition models the process from training needs assessment through program design, content creation, pilot delivery, and effectiveness evaluation.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { developEducationalTrainingPrograms } from '@headlessly/develop-educational-training-programs'

const training = developEducationalTrainingPrograms()

// Assess training needs
const needs = await training.assessTrainingNeeds({
  department: 'engineering',
  method: 'skills-gap-survey',
  competencies: ['cloud-architecture', 'CI-CD-pipelines', 'security-best-practices'],
  participants: 120
})

// Design learning pathway
const pathway = await training.designLearningPathway({
  needsId: needs.id,
  role: 'senior-software-engineer',
  modules: [
    { title: 'Cloud Infrastructure Fundamentals', hours: 8, format: 'self-paced' },
    { title: 'CI/CD Pipeline Design Workshop', hours: 16, format: 'instructor-led' },
    { title: 'Application Security Bootcamp', hours: 24, format: 'hybrid' }
  ],
  certification: 'AWS-Solutions-Architect'
})

// Deploy training
await training.deployTraining({
  pathwayId: pathway.id,
  cohorts: [
    { name: 'Cohort-A', startDate: '2026-04-01', size: 30 },
    { name: 'Cohort-B', startDate: '2026-05-01', size: 30 }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify managers when training completes
training.trainingDeployed(async ({ pathwayId, cohort }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'engineering-managers',
    message: `${cohort} enrolled in training pathway ${pathwayId} - completion expected in 6 weeks`
  })
})

// Auto-evaluate after deployment
training.effectivenessEvaluated(async ({ pathwayId, roi }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'hr-leadership',
    message: `Training pathway ${pathwayId} ROI: ${roi}% - ${roi > 100 ? 'exceeds' : 'below'} investment threshold`
  })
})
```
