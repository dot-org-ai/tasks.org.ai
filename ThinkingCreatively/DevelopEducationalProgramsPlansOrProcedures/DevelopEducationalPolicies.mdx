## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { developEducationalPolicies } from '@headlessly/develop-educational-policies'

const policies = developEducationalPolicies()

// Identify policy gaps
const gaps = await policies.identifyGaps({
  area: 'academic-integrity',
  regulations: ['FERPA', 'state-education-code'],
  currentPolicyDate: '2019-08-01',
  triggers: ['AI-generated-content', 'remote-proctoring']
})

// Draft the policy
const draft = await policies.draftPolicy({
  gapAnalysisId: gaps.id,
  title: 'Academic Integrity and AI-Assisted Work Policy',
  sections: [
    'definitions',
    'prohibited-conduct',
    'permitted-AI-use',
    'reporting-procedures',
    'adjudication-process',
    'sanctions'
  ]
})

// Solicit public comment
await policies.solicitPublicComment({
  draftId: draft.id,
  period: { start: '2026-03-01', end: '2026-03-31' },
  audiences: ['faculty', 'students', 'parents']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify community when policy is adopted
policies.policyAdopted(async ({ policyId, title }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'campus-community',
    message: `New policy adopted: ${title} - effective next semester`
  })
})

// Close comment period and trigger compliance review
policies.publicCommentSolicited(async ({ draftId, endDate }) => {
  await scheduleTask({
    date: endDate,
    action: () => policies.conductComplianceReview({ draftId })
  })
})
```
