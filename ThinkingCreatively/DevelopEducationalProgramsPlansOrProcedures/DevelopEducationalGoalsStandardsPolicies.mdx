## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { developEducationalGoalsStandardsPolicies } from '@headlessly/develop-educational-goals-standards-policies'

const edGoals = developEducationalGoalsStandardsPolicies()

// Articulate institutional goals
const goals = await edGoals.articulateGoals({
  institution: 'Westfield University',
  strategicPriorities: ['student-success', 'research-excellence', 'community-engagement'],
  outcomes: [
    'All graduates demonstrate critical thinking proficiency',
    'Retention rates exceed 85% by 2028',
    'Research expenditures grow 10% annually'
  ]
})

// Draft academic standards
const standards = await edGoals.draftStandards({
  goalsId: goals.id,
  area: 'general-education',
  standards: [
    { competency: 'written-communication', benchmark: 'score-4-on-AAC&U-VALUE-rubric' },
    { competency: 'quantitative-reasoning', benchmark: 'pass-QR-assessment-at-70%' },
    { competency: 'information-literacy', benchmark: 'complete-IL-portfolio' }
  ]
})

// Develop supporting policy
await edGoals.developPolicies({
  standardsId: standards.id,
  policy: 'General Education Assessment Policy',
  sections: ['purpose', 'scope', 'assessment-cycle', 'reporting-requirements', 'use-of-results']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify accreditor liaison when standards are adopted
edGoals.governanceAdopted(async ({ standardsId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'accreditation-liaison',
    message: `Academic standards ${standardsId} adopted - update accreditation evidence files`
  })
})

// Schedule periodic review
edGoals.reviewCompleted(async ({ standardsId }) => {
  await scheduleReminder({
    date: addYears(new Date(), 3),
    to: 'chief-academic-officer',
    message: `Three-year review due for standards ${standardsId}`
  })
})
```
