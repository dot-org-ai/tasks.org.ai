## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { establishOperationalPolicies } from '@headlessly/establish-operational-policies'

const policies = establishOperationalPolicies()

// Identify the policy need
const need = await policies.identifyNeed({
  area: 'remote-work-eligibility',
  trigger: 'post-pandemic-hybrid-transition',
  affectedDepartments: ['academic-affairs', 'student-services', 'facilities']
})

// Draft the policy
const draft = await policies.draftPolicy({
  needId: need.id,
  title: 'Flexible Work Arrangement Policy',
  scope: 'all-full-time-staff',
  sections: ['eligibility', 'schedule-requirements', 'equipment-provision', 'performance-expectations'],
  effectiveDate: '2026-07-01'
})

// Conduct legal review
await policies.conductLegalReview({
  draftId: draft.id,
  regulations: ['FLSA', 'ADA', 'state-labor-code'],
  reviewer: 'general-counsel'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify all staff when policy is adopted
policies.policyDisseminated(async ({ policyId, title }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'all-staff',
    message: `New policy adopted: ${title} - review in the policy portal`
  })
})

// Flag overdue compliance reviews
policies.approvalObtained(async ({ policyId, reviewDate }) => {
  await scheduleReminder({
    date: reviewDate,
    to: 'compliance-officer',
    message: `Annual review due for policy ${policyId}`
  })
})
```
