## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { planEducationalActivities } from '@headlessly/plan-educational-activities'

const activities = planEducationalActivities()

// Align to objectives
const aligned = await activities.alignObjectives({
  course: 'AP-Biology',
  unit: 'cellular-respiration',
  objectives: ['explain-glycolysis-steps', 'compare-aerobic-anaerobic', 'analyze-ATP-yield']
})

// Design the activity
const activity = await activities.designActivity({
  alignmentId: aligned.id,
  type: 'laboratory-exercise',
  title: 'Measuring Cellular Respiration in Germinating Seeds',
  duration: { value: 90, unit: 'minutes' },
  groupSize: 4,
  materials: ['respirometer', 'germinating-peas', 'glass-beads', 'KOH-solution']
})

// Schedule the session
await activities.scheduleSession({
  activityId: activity.id,
  date: '2026-03-15',
  room: 'science-lab-204',
  period: 3
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Remind instructor to prepare materials
activities.sessionScheduled(async ({ activityId, date }) => {
  await scheduleReminder({
    date: subtractDays(date, 3),
    to: 'instructor',
    message: `Materials needed for activity ${activityId} in 3 days`
  })
})

// Collect effectiveness feedback after delivery
activities.activityDelivered(async ({ activityId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'students',
    message: `Please complete the feedback survey for today's activity ${activityId}`
  })
})
```
