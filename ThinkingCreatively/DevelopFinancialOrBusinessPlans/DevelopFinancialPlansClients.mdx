// Gather client data
const profile = await planning.gatherClientData({
  clientName: 'Sarah Johnson',
  age: 42,
  annualIncome: 185000,
  goals: ['retirement-at-62', 'college-funding', 'estate-planning'],
  riskTolerance: 'moderate'
})

// Analyze net worth
const netWorth = await planning.analyzeNetWorth({
  clientId: profile.id,
  assets: [
    { type: '401k', value: 420000 },
    { type: 'brokerage', value: 150000 },

  await scheduleReview({
    clientId,
    planId,
    frequency: 'annual',
    nextDate: addYears(new Date(), 1)
  })
})

// Alert planner when net worth changes significantly
planning.netWorthAnalyzed(async ({ clientId, currentNetWorth, previousNetWorth }) => {
  const change = Math.abs((currentNetWorth - previousNetWorth) / previousNetWorth)
  if (change > 0.15) {
    await notify({
      to: 'advisory-team',
