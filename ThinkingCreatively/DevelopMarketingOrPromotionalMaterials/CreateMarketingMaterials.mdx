## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { createMarketingMaterials } from '@headlessly/create-marketing-materials'

const marketing = createMarketingMaterials()

// Define material requirements
const req = await marketing.defineRequirements({
  campaign: 'Q2 Lead Generation',
  type: 'landing-page',
  audience: 'enterprise-IT-directors',
  channel: 'web',
  objective: 'demo-request-conversion'
})

// Create the asset
const asset = await marketing.createAsset({
  requirementsId: req.id,
  templateId: 'enterprise-landing-v3',
  headline: 'Automate Your Infrastructure in Minutes',
  bodyContent: 'See how leading enterprises reduce deployment time by 80%...',
  callToAction: 'Request a Demo'
})

// Generate A/B variants
await marketing.generateVariants({
  assetId: asset.id,
  variations: [
    { element: 'headline', value: 'Ship Faster with Zero Downtime' },
    { element: 'callToAction', value: 'Start Free Trial' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert team when asset performance exceeds targets
marketing.performanceMeasured(async ({ assetId, conversionRate }) => {
  if (conversionRate > 0.05) {
    await notify({
      to: 'marketing-team',
      message: `Asset ${assetId} achieving ${(conversionRate * 100).toFixed(1)}% conversion - above 5% target`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-publish winning variant after A/B test concludes
marketing.variantsGenerated(async ({ assetId, variants }) => {
  await marketing.publishAsset({
    assetId,
    variants: variants.map(v => v.id),
    testDuration: '7d'
  })
})
```
