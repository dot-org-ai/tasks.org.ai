### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { analyzeInformationObtainedNewsSources } from '@headlessly/analyze-information-obtained-news-sources'

const newsAnalysis = analyzeInformationObtainedNewsSources()

const source = await newsAnalysis.ingestSource({
  type: 'wire-service',
  provider: 'Associated Press',
  headline: 'Federal Reserve Announces Rate Decision',
  content: 'The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady...',
  receivedAt: '2026-01-15T14:30:00Z'

// Cross-reference with government data
await newsAnalysis.crossReference({
  storyLeadId: source.storyLeadId,
  sources: ['federal-reserve-statement', 'treasury-data', 'bls-employment-report']
})

// Synthesize findings into a brief
const brief = await newsAnalysis.synthesizeFindings({
  storyLeadId: source.storyLeadId,

```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert editors when discrepancies are found
newsAnalysis.discrepancyFlagged(async ({ storyLeadId, sources, details }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'assignment-desk',
    message: `Conflicting information detected on story ${storyLeadId}: ${details}`
  })
})

// Auto-prioritize stories when analysis is complete
newsAnalysis.analysisSynthesized(async ({ storyLeadId, brief }) => {
  await newsAnalysis.prioritizeStory({
    storyLeadId,
    newsworthiness: brief.impactScore,
    timeliness: brief.urgencyLevel
  })
