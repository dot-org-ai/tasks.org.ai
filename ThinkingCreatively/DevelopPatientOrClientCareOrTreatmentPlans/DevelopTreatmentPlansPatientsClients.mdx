## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { developTreatmentPlansPatientsClients } from '@headlessly/develop-treatment-plans-patients-clients'

const plans = developTreatmentPlansPatientsClients()

// Assess patient and review diagnostics
const assessment = await plans.assessPatient({
  patientId: 'pat-5582',
  type: 'comprehensive',
  domains: ['medical', 'functional', 'psychosocial']
})

// Select interventions based on diagnosis
const interventions = await plans.selectInterventions({
  diagnosisCode: 'M54.5',
  guidelines: 'lumbarRadiculopathy-2025',
  patientFactors: { age: 45, comorbidities: ['hypertension'] }
})

// Draft and submit the treatment plan
const plan = await plans.draftPlan({
  patientId: 'pat-5582',
  diagnosis: 'M54.5',
  interventions: interventions.selected,
  goals: [
    { description: 'Reduce pain to 3/10 or below', measure: 'vasScale', target: 3, weeks: 8 },
    { description: 'Return to work duties', measure: 'functionalCapacity', target: 'fullDuty', weeks: 12 }
  ]
})

await plans.submitForApproval({ planId: plan.id })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify care team when plan is activated
plans.planActivated(async ({ planId, patientId, interventions }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'care-team',
    message: `Treatment plan ${planId} activated with ${interventions.length} interventions`
  })
})

// Schedule follow-up review after plan approval
plans.planApproved(async ({ planId, patientId }) => {
  await scheduleReview({
    planId,
    patientId,
    reviewDate: addWeeks(new Date(), 4)
  })
})
```
