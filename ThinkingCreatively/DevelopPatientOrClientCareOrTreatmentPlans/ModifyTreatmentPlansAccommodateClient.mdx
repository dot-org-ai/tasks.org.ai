# Modify Treatment Plans Accommodate Client

> Business-as-Code definition for modifying treatment plans to accommodate changing client needs, preferences, and clinical circumstances.

## Overview

Modifying treatment plans to accommodate client needs involves reviewing existing care protocols and adjusting interventions based on patient progress, side effects, lifestyle changes, or evolving clinical presentations.

This process is central to patient-centered care across medical, behavioral health, and rehabilitative settings.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { modifyTreatmentPlansAccommodateClient } from '@headlessly/modify-treatment-plans-accommodate-client'

const plans = modifyTreatmentPlansAccommodateClient()

// Review current plan effectiveness
const review = await plans.reviewCurrentPlan({
  treatmentPlanId: 'tp-2024-0892',
  patientId: 'pat-4471',
  assessmentDate: '2026-02-05'
})

// Identify barriers to adherence
const barriers = await plans.identifyBarriers({
  treatmentPlanId: 'tp-2024-0892',
  categories: ['sideEffects', 'scheduling', 'financial']
})

// Propose and apply modification
const modification = await plans.proposeModification({
  treatmentPlanId: 'tp-2024-0892',
  changes: [
    { element: 'sessionFrequency', from: 'weekly', to: 'biweekly' },
    { element: 'modality', from: 'inPerson', to: 'telehealth' }
  ],
  rationale: 'Patient reports transportation barriers affecting attendance'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify care team when plan is updated
plans.planUpdated(async ({ treatmentPlanId, patientId, modifications }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'care-team',
    message: `Treatment plan ${treatmentPlanId} modified: ${modifications.length} changes applied`
  })
})

// Auto-flag plans needing review after barrier identification
plans.barrierIdentified(async ({ treatmentPlanId, barrier }) => {
  if (barrier.severity === 'high') {
    await escalate({
      to: 'clinical-supervisor',
      planId: treatmentPlanId,
      reason: `High-severity barrier: ${barrier.description}`
    })
  }
})
```
