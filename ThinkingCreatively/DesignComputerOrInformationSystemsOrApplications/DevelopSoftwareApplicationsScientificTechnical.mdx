# Develop Software Applications Scientific Technical

> Business-as-Code definition for developing software or applications for scientific or technical use. Models the process of building computational tools for research, engineering analysis, data processing, and laboratory automation.

## Overview

Developing software for scientific or technical use involves creating specialized applications for data analysis, laboratory instrument control, engineering simulation, bioinformatics, and research computation. These applications must handle complex numerical operations, large datasets, and domain-specific file formats while maintaining computational accuracy and reproducibility. Development often requires close collaboration between software engineers and domain scientists to ensure algorithms correctly implement established methodologies.

## Actors

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { developSoftwareApplicationsScientificTechnical } from '@headlessly/develop-software-applications-scientific-technical'

const sciDev = developSoftwareApplicationsScientificTechnical()

// Gather requirements for a genomics analysis tool
const requirements = await sciDev.gatherScientificRequirements({
  applicationName: 'GenomeVariantCaller',
  domain: 'bioinformatics',
  capabilities: ['variant-detection', 'quality-filtering', 'annotation'],
  inputFormats: ['BAM', 'CRAM', 'VCF'],
  performanceTarget: { genomes: 100, hours: 4 }
})

// Implement the core variant detection algorithm
const algorithm = await sciDev.implementAlgorithm({
  applicationId: requirements.applicationId,
  name: 'bayesian-variant-caller',
  method: 'bayesian-inference',
  language: 'Rust',
  parallelism: 'multi-threaded'
})

// Run a validation experiment
const experiment = await sciDev.runExperiment({
  applicationId: requirements.applicationId,
  inputDataset: 'giab-hg002-30x',
  parameters: { minQuality: 30, minDepth: 10, ploidy: 2 },
  computeProfile: 'hpc-64core'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-validate accuracy when experiment completes
sciDev.experimentCompleted(async ({ applicationId, experimentId }) => {
  await sciDev.validateAccuracy({
    experimentId,
    referenceDataset: 'giab-truth-set',
    metrics: ['sensitivity', 'specificity', 'f1-score']
  })
})

// Package for distribution when methodology is documented
sciDev.methodologyDocumented(async ({ applicationId, version }) => {
  await sciDev.packageDistribution({
    applicationId,
    version,
    formats: ['docker', 'conda', 'pip'],
    license: 'BSD-3-Clause'
  })
})
```
