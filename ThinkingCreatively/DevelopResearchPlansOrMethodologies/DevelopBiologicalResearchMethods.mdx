# Develop Biological Research Methods

> Business-as-Code definition for developing biological research methods that advance techniques for studying living organisms, cellular processes, genetics, and ecosystems.

## Overview

Developing biological research methods involves designing novel experimental techniques, creating assay protocols, establishing bioinformatics pipelines, and developing field and laboratory procedures for studying biological systems. This definition exposes actions for method creation, assay development, validation, and standardization. It provides events for automating method lifecycle management and searches for retrieving method libraries, validation outcomes, and adoption data.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { developBiologicalResearchMethods } from '@headlessly/develop-biological-research-methods'

const bioMethods = developBiologicalResearchMethods()

// Design a new biological method
const method = await bioMethods.designBiologicalMethod({
  name: 'CRISPR-Based Gene Expression Reporter Assay',
  discipline: 'Molecular Biology',
  objective: 'Real-time monitoring of gene expression changes in live cells',
  biosafety: 'BSL-2',
  organisms: ['HEK293T', 'iPSC']
})

// Develop the assay protocol
await bioMethods.developAssayProtocol({
  methodId: method.id,
  protocol: {
    name: 'Fluorescent Reporter Quantification',
    steps: [
      'Transfect cells with CRISPR reporter construct',
      'Incubate for 48 hours at 37C with 5% CO2',
      'Measure fluorescence intensity at 488nm excitation',
      'Normalize to internal control reporter'
    ],
    reagents: ['Cas9-mRNA', 'guide-RNA', 'reporter-plasmid', 'lipofectamine'],
    readout: 'fluorescence-intensity'
  }
})

// Run validation experiment
const validation = await bioMethods.conductValidationExperiment({
  methodId: method.id,
  replicates: 6,
  controls: ['positive', 'negative', 'no-transfection'],
  acceptanceCriteria: { sensitivity: 0.85, coefficientOfVariation: 0.15 }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-standardize when validation passes
bioMethods.validationExperimentConducted(async ({ methodId, results }) => {
  if (results.sensitivity >= 0.85 && results.cv <= 0.15) {
    await bioMethods.standardizeMethod({
      methodId,
      sopFormat: 'ISO-17025'
    })
  }
})

// Notify collaborators when method is published
bioMethods.methodPublished(async ({ methodId, publication }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'collaborating-laboratories',
    message: `New biological method published: ${publication.title} (DOI: ${publication.doi})`
  })
})
```
