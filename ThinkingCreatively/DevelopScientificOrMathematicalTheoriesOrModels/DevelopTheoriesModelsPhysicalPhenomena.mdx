# Develop Theories Models Physical Phenomena

> Business-as-Code definition for developing theories and models of physical phenomena. Models the theoretical physics workflow from observation and hypothesis through mathematical formulation, experimental testing, and theory refinement.

## Overview

Developing theories and models of physical phenomena involves constructing mathematical frameworks that describe the behavior of matter, energy, forces, and fields. This encompasses formulating hypotheses from experimental observations, deriving predictive equations, designing experiments to test theoretical predictions, and iteratively refining models to achieve agreement with empirical data. This definition provides actions for the theoretical and experimental physics pipeline used in research laboratories, national facilities, and engineering R&D centers.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { developTheoriesModelsPhysicalPhenomena } from '@headlessly/develop-theories-models-physical-phenomena'

const physics = developTheoriesModelsPhysicalPhenomena()

// Observe and characterize an anomalous signal
const observation = await physics.observePhenomenon({
  domain: 'condensed-matter',
  description: 'Anomalous resistivity drop in layered perovskite at 180K',
  facility: 'argonne-national-lab',
  measurements: ['resistivity', 'magnetic-susceptibility', 'specific-heat']
})

// Derive a theoretical model
const model = await physics.deriveModel({
  hypothesisId: observation.hypothesisId,
  framework: 'BCS-extended',
  governingEquations: ['gap-equation', 'eliashberg-equations'],
  freeParameters: ['coupling-constant', 'phonon-frequency']
})

// Compare predictions with measurements
await physics.comparePredictions({
  modelId: model.id,
  experimentId: 'perovskite-transport-2025',
  metric: 'chi-squared'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-design follow-up experiments when predictions disagree
physics.predictionsCompared(async ({ modelId, chiSquared, pValue }) => {
  if (pValue < 0.05) {
    await physics.refineTheory({
      modelId,
      reason: `Chi-squared=${chiSquared.toFixed(2)}, p=${pValue.toFixed(4)} - significant deviation`
    })
  }
})

// Notify collaborators when new theory is derived
physics.modelDerived(async ({ modelId, domain, framework }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'physics-collaboration',
    message: `New ${framework} model ${modelId} derived for ${domain} - ready for experimental design`
  })
})
```
