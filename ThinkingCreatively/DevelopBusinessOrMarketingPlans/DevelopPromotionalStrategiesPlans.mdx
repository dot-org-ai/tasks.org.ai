### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { developPromotionalStrategiesPlans } from '@headlessly/develop-promotional-strategies-plans'

const promos = developPromotionalStrategiesPlans()

// Analyze the market landscape
const market = await promos.analyzeMarket({
  industry: 'consumer-electronics',
  region: 'North America',
  competitors: ['Brand A', 'Brand B', 'Brand C'],
  timeframe: 'Q2-2026'
})

// Define audience segments
await promos.defineAudienceSegments({
  planId: market.planId,
  segments: [
    { name: 'Tech Early Adopters', age: '25-40', interests: ['gadgets', 'innovation'] },
    { name: 'Value Seekers', age: '30-55', interests: ['deals', 'reliability'] }

    { name: 'Search Ads', weight: 0.25 },

promos.performanceMeasured(async ({ campaignId, metrics }) => {
  if (metrics.roas < 2.0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'promotions-manager',
      message: `Campaign ${campaignId} ROAS is ${metrics.roas.toFixed(1)}x - below 2.0x target, optimization recommended`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-scale budget for high-performing campaigns
promos.campaignLaunched(async ({ campaignId, planId }) => {
  // Schedule first performance check
  await schedule({
    action: 'measurePerformance',
    campaignId,
    delay: { value: 7, unit: 'days' }
  })
})
```
