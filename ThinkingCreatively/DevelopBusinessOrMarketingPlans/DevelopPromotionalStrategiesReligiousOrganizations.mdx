### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { developPromotionalStrategiesReligiousOrganizations } from '@headlessly/develop-promotional-strategies-religious-organizations'

const outreach = developPromotionalStrategiesReligiousOrganizations()

// Create a promotional strategy for a community event
const strategy = await outreach.createPromotionalStrategy({
  name: 'Fall Community Open House',
  organization: 'First Community Church',
  period: { start: '2026-08-01', end: '2026-10-31' },
  goals: ['Increase attendance by 30%', 'Reach 500 new community members']
})

// Define target outreach audience
await outreach.defineOutreachAudience({
  strategyId: strategy.id,
  audiences: [
    { name: 'Young Families', demographics: { ageRange: '25-40', hasChildren: true } },
    { name: 'New Residents', demographics: { residenceDuration: 'under-1-year' } }

await outreach.launchOutreachCampaign({
  strategyId: strategy.id,
  channels: ['social-media', 'local-newspaper', 'community-bulletin-board']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify team when engagement milestones are reached
outreach.engagementTracked(async ({ strategyId, metrics }) => {
  if (metrics.newContacts >= 100) {
    await notify({
      to: 'outreach-director',
      message: `Campaign ${strategyId} reached 100 new contacts`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-evaluate strategy when campaign concludes
outreach.outreachCampaignLaunched(async ({ strategyId, endDate }) => {
  await scheduleAt(endDate, () =>
    outreach.evaluateStrategyEffectiveness({ strategyId })
  )
})
```
