```typescript
import { supportProfessionalDevelopmentOthers } from '@headlessly/support-professional-development-others'

const development = supportProfessionalDevelopmentOthers()

// Create a development plan for a team member
const plan = await development.createDevelopmentPlan({
  employeeId: 'emp_456',
  focus: ['technical_leadership', 'public_speaking'],
  duration: '12_months',
  budget: 5000
})

// Assess current competencies
const assessment = await development.assessCompetencies({
  employeeId: 'emp_456',
  competencies: [
    { name: 'Project Management', level: 'intermediate' },
    { name: 'Data Analysis', level: 'beginner' }
  ]

  for (const gap of gaps) {
    await development.recommendActivity({
      employeeId,
      competency: gap.name,
      activityType: 'training'
    })
  }
})

// Notify manager when milestones are achieved

  await notify({
