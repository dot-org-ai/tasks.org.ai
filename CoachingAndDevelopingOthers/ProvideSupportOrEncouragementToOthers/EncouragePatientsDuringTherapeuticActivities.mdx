```typescript
import { encouragePatientsDuringTherapeuticActivities } from '@headlessly/encourage-patients-during-therapeutic-activities'

const therapy = encouragePatientsDuringTherapeuticActivities()

// Offer encouragement during a session
await therapy.offerEncouragement({
  patientId: 'patient-321',
  sessionId: 'session-789',
  message: 'Great effort on that range of motion exercise',
  deliveryMethod: 'verbal'
})

// Recognize patient progress
await therapy.recognizeProgress({
  patientId: 'patient-321',
  achievement: 'Completed 10 repetitions independently',

  inviteFamily: true
})
```

```typescript
// Auto-celebrate when milestones are reached
therapy.progressRecognized(async ({ patientId, achievement }) => {
  const milestones = await therapy.getProgress({ patientId })
  if (milestones.length % 5 === 0) {
    await therapy.celebrateMilestone({
      patientId,
      milestone: `${milestones.length} achievements completed`,
      celebrationType: 'recognition-card'
    })
  }
})

// Alert therapist when barriers are identified
therapy.barrierIdentified(async ({ patientId, barrier }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'therapy-provider',
    message: `Patient ${patientId} experiencing barrier: ${barrier.description}`
  })
})
