### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { interactPatientsBuildRapportProvide } from '@headlessly/interact-patients-build-rapport-provide'

const patientSupport = interactPatientsBuildRapportProvide()

// Initiate contact with a new patient
const interaction = await patientSupport.initiateContact({
  patientId: 'patient-567',
  method: 'in-person',
  purpose: 'initial-intake',
  culturalConsiderations: ['interpreter-needed', 'family-centered-care']
})

// Practice active listening and assess emotional state
await patientSupport.practiceActiveListening({
  interactionId: interaction.id,
  patientConcerns: ['fear-of-procedure', 'family-stress'],
  validationResponse: 'I understand this is a difficult time for you'
})

const assessment = await patientSupport.assessEmotionalState({
  patientId: 'patient-567',
  indicators: ['anxiety', 'sadness'],
  severity: 'moderate'
})

// Provide supportive response
await patientSupport.provideSupportiveResponse({
  patientId: 'patient-567',
  interventionType: 'reassurance',
  message: 'We are here to support you through every step'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Escalate when high emotional distress is detected
patientSupport.emotionalStateAssessed(async ({ patientId, severity }) => {
  if (severity === 'severe') {
    await notify({
      to: 'behavioral-health-specialist',
      message: `Patient ${patientId} requires immediate emotional support consultation`,
      priority: 'urgent'
    })
  }
})

// Track rapport development over time
patientSupport.trustEstablished(async ({ patientId, interactionId }) => {
  await updateMetrics({
    patientId,
    metric: 'rapport-quality',
    value: 'established',
    timestamp: new Date()
  })
})
