## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { identifyImplicationsCasesLegalPrecedents } from '@headlessly/identify-implications-cases-legal-precedents'

const precedents = identifyImplicationsCasesLegalPrecedents()

// Research precedents for employment discrimination case
const research = await precedents.researchPrecedents({
  currentCaseId: 'smith-v-acme-corp',
  legalIssues: ['wrongful-termination', 'age-discrimination', 'retaliation'],
  jurisdictions: ['federal', 'state-california'],
  dateRange: { start: '2010-01-01', end: '2026-01-01' }
})

// Assess relevance of found precedents
const relevance = await precedents.assessRelevance({
  currentCaseId: 'smith-v-acme-corp',
  precedentIds: research.cases.map(c => c.id),
  factorsToMatch: ['employment-type', 'protected-class', 'damages-type']
})

// Develop legal strategy based on precedent analysis
const strategy = await precedents.developStrategy({
  currentCaseId: 'smith-v-acme-corp',
  strongPrecedents: relevance.strong,
  weakPrecedents: relevance.weak,
  strategicGoals: ['summary-judgment', 'damages-maximization']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Analyze holdings when relevance assessed
precedents.relevanceAssessed(async ({ currentCaseId, relevantPrecedents }) => {
  if (relevantPrecedents.length > 0) {
    await precedents.analyzeHoldings({
      currentCaseId,
      precedentIds: relevantPrecedents.map(p => p.id),
      focusOn: ['legal-standards', 'burden-of-proof', 'remedy-types']
    })
  }
})

// Document findings after strategy developed
precedents.strategyDeveloped(async ({ currentCaseId, strategy }) => {
  await precedents.documentFindings({
    currentCaseId,
    includeStrategy: true,
    format: 'legal-memorandum',
    recipient: 'lead-counsel'
  })
})
```
