# Apply Mathematical Principles or Statistical Approaches

> Business-as-Code definition for applying mathematical principles and statistical approaches to solve problems in scientific or applied fields. Models the formulation, computation, validation, and interpretation of mathematical models and statistical analyses used in engineering, physical sciences, operations research, and data science.

## Overview

Applying mathematical principles or statistical approaches involves formulating mathematical models, selecting appropriate statistical methods, executing computational analyses, validating results, and interpreting findings to solve problems in engineering, physical sciences, economics, and operations research. This definition provides actions for problem formulation, method selection, computation, validation, and results reporting. It supports mathematicians, statisticians, data scientists, operations researchers, and scientific computing specialists.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { applyMathematicalPrinciplesStatisticalApproaches } from '@headlessly/apply-mathematical-principles-statistical-approaches'

const analyst = applyMathematicalPrinciplesStatisticalApproaches()

// Formulate and solve an optimization problem
const analysis = await analyst.formulateProblem({
  domain: 'supply-chain-optimization',
  type: 'mixed-integer-linear-program',
  objective: 'minimize-total-cost',
  constraints: ['capacity', 'demand-satisfaction', 'lead-time']
})

await analyst.selectMethods({
  analysisId: analysis.id,
  methods: ['branch-and-bound', 'sensitivity-analysis']
})

await analyst.prepareData({
  analysisId: analysis.id,
  sources: ['demand-forecasts', 'supplier-costs', 'transportation-rates']
})

await analyst.executeComputation({ analysisId: analysis.id })
await analyst.validateResults({ analysisId: analysis.id })
await analyst.interpretFindings({ analysisId: analysis.id })
await analyst.publishAnalysis({ analysisId: analysis.id })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on validation failures
analyst.resultsValidated(async ({ analysisId, isValid, validationMetrics }) => {
  if (!isValid) {
    await notify({
      to: 'modeling-team',
      message: `Validation failed for analysis ${analysisId}: ${validationMetrics.failureReason}`
    })
  }
})

// Distribute published analyses
analyst.analysisPublished(async ({ analysisId, reportId, domain }) => {
  await distribute({ reportId, recipients: ['research-team', 'engineering', 'decision-makers'] })
})
```
