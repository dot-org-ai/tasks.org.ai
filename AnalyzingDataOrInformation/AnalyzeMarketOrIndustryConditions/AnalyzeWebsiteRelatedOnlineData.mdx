## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { analyzeWebsiteRelatedOnlineData } from '@headlessly/analyze-website-related-online-data'

const analyst = analyzeWebsiteRelatedOnlineData()

// Collect web analytics
const analysis = await analyst.collectWebAnalytics({
  sites: ['www.example.com', 'blog.example.com'],
  platforms: ['google-analytics', 'search-console', 'social-insights'],
  period: { start: '2025-10-01', end: '2025-12-31' }
})

// Analyze behavior and performance
await analyst.analyzeUserBehavior({ analysisId: analysis.id })
await analyst.trackSearchPerformance({ analysisId: analysis.id })
await analyst.measureSocialEngagement({ analysisId: analysis.id })
await analyst.assessConversionFunnels({
  analysisId: analysis.id,
  funnels: ['signup-flow', 'purchase-flow', 'demo-request']
})

// Segment and report
await analyst.segmentAudiences({ analysisId: analysis.id })
await analyst.generatePerformanceReport({ analysisId: analysis.id })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on conversion funnel drops
analyst.conversionFunnelsAssessed(async ({ analysisId, funnel, dropoffRate }) => {
  if (dropoffRate > 0.6) {
    await notify({
      to: 'product-team',
      message: `High dropoff rate (${(dropoffRate * 100).toFixed(0)}%) detected in ${funnel} funnel`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-distribute performance reports
analyst.performanceReportGenerated(async ({ analysisId, reportId }) => {
  await distribute({ reportId, recipients: ['marketing-team', 'content-team', 'executive-dashboard'] })
})
```
