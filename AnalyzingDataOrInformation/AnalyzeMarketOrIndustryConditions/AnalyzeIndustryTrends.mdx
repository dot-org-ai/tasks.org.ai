## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { analyzeIndustryTrends } from '@headlessly/analyze-industry-trends'

const analyst = analyzeIndustryTrends()

// Source sector data
const analysis = await analyst.sourceSectorData({
  sector: 'enterprise-SaaS',
  dataSources: ['gartner-market-guide', 'IDC-tracker', 'SEC-10K-filings', 'crunchbase-funding'],
  period: { start: '2024-01-01', end: '2025-12-31' }
})

// Detect and assess trends
await analyst.detectEmergingTrends({ analysisId: analysis.id })
await analyst.assessCompetitiveDynamics({ analysisId: analysis.id })
await analyst.evaluateRegulatoryImpact({ analysisId: analysis.id })
await analyst.trackTechnologyAdoption({
  analysisId: analysis.id,
  technologies: ['AI-copilots', 'usage-based-pricing', 'composable-architecture']
