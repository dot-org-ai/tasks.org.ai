# Forecast Economic, Political, or Social Trends

> Business-as-Code definition for forecasting economic, political, and social trends. Models the analysis of macroeconomic indicators, political risk factors, demographic shifts, and social movements to project future conditions that impact business strategy, investment decisions, and policy development.

## Overview

Forecasting economic, political, or social trends involves analyzing GDP growth, inflation rates, employment data, political stability indicators, legislative agendas, demographic projections, and social sentiment data to project future conditions and their business implications. This definition provides actions for indicator collection, model construction, scenario development, and forecast dissemination. It supports economists, political risk analysts, social researchers, investment strategists, and corporate planning teams.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { forecastEconomicPoliticalSocialTrends } from '@headlessly/forecast-economic-political-social-trends'

const forecaster = forecastEconomicPoliticalSocialTrends()

// Collect indicator data
const forecast = await forecaster.collectIndicatorData({
  regions: ['north-america', 'european-union', 'asia-pacific'],
  indicators: ['GDP-growth', 'CPI-inflation', 'unemployment-rate', 'trade-balance'],
  sources: ['IMF-WEO', 'world-bank-GDI', 'OECD-outlook']
})

// Build models and project conditions
await forecaster.buildForecastModel({
  forecastId: forecast.id,
  method: 'vector-autoregression',
  horizon: { quarters: 8 }
})

await forecaster.projectEconomicConditions({ forecastId: forecast.id })
await forecaster.assessPoliticalRisk({ forecastId: forecast.id })
await forecaster.projectDemographicShifts({ forecastId: forecast.id })

// Develop scenarios and publish
await forecaster.developScenarios({
  forecastId: forecast.id,
  scenarios: ['baseline', 'stagflation', 'rapid-recovery']
})
await forecaster.publishForecastReport({ forecastId: forecast.id })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert investment team on significant risk changes
forecaster.politicalRiskAssessed(async ({ forecastId, region, riskLevel, previousLevel }) => {
  if (riskLevel > previousLevel + 2) {
    await notify({
      to: 'investment-committee',
      message: `Political risk elevated in ${region}: ${previousLevel} to ${riskLevel}`
    })
  }
})

// Distribute published forecast
forecaster.forecastReportPublished(async ({ forecastId, reportId }) => {
  await distribute({ reportId, recipients: ['executive-team', 'strategy-department', 'investor-relations'] })
})
```
