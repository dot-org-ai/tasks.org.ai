## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { analyzeMarketConditionsTrends } from '@headlessly/analyze-market-conditions-trends'

const analyst = analyzeMarketConditionsTrends()

// Aggregate market data
const analysis = await analyst.aggregateMarketData({
  market: 'enterprise-cloud-services',
  sources: ['gartner-tracker', 'IDC-spending-guide', 'public-earnings-reports'],
  period: { start: '2025-01-01', end: '2025-12-31' }
})

// Assess conditions and identify trends
await analyst.assessCurrentConditions({ analysisId: analysis.id })
await analyst.identifyTrends({ analysisId: analysis.id })
await analyst.analyzeSupplyDemand({ analysisId: analysis.id })
await analyst.benchmarkAgainstCompetitors({
  analysisId: analysis.id,
  competitors: ['aws', 'azure', 'gcp']
})

// Generate report
await analyst.generateTrendReport({ analysisId: analysis.id })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on significant market signals
analyst.marketSignalDetected(async ({ analysisId, signal, strength }) => {
  if (strength === 'strong') {
    await notify({
      to: 'strategy-team',
      message: `Strong market signal detected: ${signal.description}`
    })
  }
})

// Distribute trend reports to stakeholders
analyst.trendReportGenerated(async ({ analysisId, reportId, market }) => {
  await distribute({ reportId, recipients: ['executive-team', 'sales-leadership', 'product-management'] })
})
```
