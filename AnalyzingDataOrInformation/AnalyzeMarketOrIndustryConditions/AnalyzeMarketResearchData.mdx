# Analyze Market Research Data

> Business-as-Code definition for analyzing market research data. Models the processing and interpretation of survey responses, focus group findings, competitive intelligence, and secondary research to extract actionable insights about market size, customer preferences, and competitive positioning.

## Overview

Analyzing market research data involves processing primary research outputs such as survey responses, interview transcripts, and focus group recordings alongside secondary data including published reports, patent filings, and regulatory filings to develop market sizing estimates, customer preference models, and competitive landscape assessments. This definition provides actions for data preparation, statistical analysis, theme extraction, and insight synthesis. It supports market researchers, product managers, brand strategists, and business development professionals.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { analyzeMarketResearchData } from '@headlessly/analyze-market-research-data'

const researcher = analyzeMarketResearchData()

// Prepare and analyze survey data
const study = await researcher.prepareSurveyData({
  studyId: 'customer-preference-Q4-2025',
  rawData: 'survey-responses-export.csv',
  codingScheme: 'preference-study-v3'
})

await researcher.runStatisticalAnalysis({ studyId: study.id, methods: ['regression', 'factor-analysis'] })
await researcher.crossTabulateResponses({
  studyId: study.id,
  dimensions: ['company-size', 'industry', 'region']
})

// Qualitative analysis and market sizing
await researcher.extractQualitativeThemes({ studyId: study.id })
await researcher.estimateMarketSize({
  studyId: study.id,
  methods: ['top-down', 'bottom-up'],
  segments: ['SMB', 'mid-market', 'enterprise']
})

// Synthesize insights
await researcher.synthesizeInsights({ studyId: study.id })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify product team of significant themes
researcher.qualitativeThemesExtracted(async ({ studyId, themes }) => {
  const urgent = themes.filter(t => t.frequency > 0.4)
  if (urgent.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'product-team',
      message: `${urgent.length} high-frequency themes found: ${urgent.map(t => t.name).join(', ')}`
    })
  }
})

// Distribute final insights
researcher.insightsSynthesized(async ({ studyId, reportId }) => {
  await distribute({ reportId, recipients: ['executive-team', 'marketing', 'product-strategy'] })
})
```
