## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { analyzeConsumerTrends } from '@headlessly/analyze-consumer-trends'

const analyst = analyzeConsumerTrends()

// Collect consumer data
const analysis = await analyst.collectConsumerData({
  categories: ['health-wellness', 'sustainable-products', 'direct-to-consumer'],
  sources: ['nielsen-panel', 'social-listening-feed', 'ecommerce-transaction-logs'],
  period: { start: '2024-06-01', end: '2025-12-31' }
})

// Detect and analyze trends
await analyst.detectEmergingTrends({ analysisId: analysis.id })
await analyst.analyzePurchasePatterns({ analysisId: analysis.id })
await analyst.measureConsumerSentiment({
  analysisId: analysis.id,
  brands: ['brand-alpha', 'brand-beta', 'category-generic']
})

// Model adoption and generate report
await analyst.modelAdoptionCurves({ analysisId: analysis.id })
await analyst.generateTrendInsights({ analysisId: analysis.id })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert brand team on emerging trends
analyst.emergingTrendDetected(async ({ analysisId, trend, category, strength }) => {
  if (strength === 'strong') {
    await notify({
      to: 'brand-strategy-team',
      message: `Strong emerging consumer trend in ${category}: ${trend.name}`
    })
  }
})
