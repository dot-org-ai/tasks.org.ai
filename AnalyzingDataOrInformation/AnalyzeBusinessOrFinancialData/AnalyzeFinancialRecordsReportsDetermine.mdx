# Analyze Financial Records or Reports to Determine State of Operations

> Business-as-Code definition for analyzing financial records and reports to assess operational health. Models the process of evaluating financial performance indicators, solvency measures, and operational metrics to determine current business standing.

## Overview

Analyzing financial records and reports to determine the state of operations involves reviewing income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and management reports to assess whether an organization is operating efficiently, meeting its financial targets, and maintaining adequate liquidity. This analysis identifies operational strengths and weaknesses, flags financial distress signals, and provides the factual foundation for corrective action. It supports board-level governance, operational turnaround planning, merger due diligence, and ongoing performance management.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { analyzeFinancialRecordsReportsDetermine } from '@headlessly/analyze-financial-records-reports-determine'

const ops = analyzeFinancialRecordsReportsDetermine()

// Compile all financial records for the subsidiary
const records = await ops.compileFinancialRecords({
  entityId: 'subsidiary-west',
  periods: ['Q1-2026', 'Q2-2026', 'Q3-2026'],
  includeIntercompany: true
})

// Evaluate liquidity position
const liquidity = await ops.evaluateLiquidity({
  entityId: 'subsidiary-west',
  period: 'Q3-2026',
  metrics: ['current-ratio', 'quick-ratio', 'cash-burn-rate']
})

// Produce the operational state report
await ops.produceOperationalStateReport({
  entityId: 'subsidiary-west',
  period: 'Q3-2026',
  sections: ['profitability', 'liquidity', 'solvency', 'going-concern'],
  distributeTo: ['board-of-directors', 'cfo', 'external-auditor']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Escalate immediately when distress signals are detected
ops.distressSignalDetected(async ({ entityId, signalType, severity }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'cfo',
    priority: 'urgent',
    message: `Distress signal for ${entityId}: ${signalType} (severity: ${severity})`
  })
  if (severity === 'critical') {
    await ops.assessGoingConcern({ entityId })
  }
})

// Auto-generate quarterly operational state report
ops.financialRecordsCompiled(async ({ entityId, period }) => {
  if (isQuarterEnd(period)) {
    await ops.produceOperationalStateReport({
      entityId,
      period,
      sections: ['profitability', 'liquidity', 'solvency']
    })
  }
})
```
