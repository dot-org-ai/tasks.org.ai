## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { analyzeBusinessFinancialData } from '@headlessly/analyze-business-financial-data'

const analytics = analyzeBusinessFinancialData()

// Aggregate data from multiple business systems
const dataset = await analytics.aggregateData({
  sources: ['erp', 'crm', 'billing'],
  period: { start: '2025-01-01', end: '2025-12-31' },
  granularity: 'monthly'
})

// Segment revenue by product line and geography
const segments = await analytics.segmentRevenue({
  datasetId: dataset.id,
  dimensions: ['product-line', 'region'],
  period: 'FY2025'
})

// Build a growth scenario
const scenario = await analytics.buildScenario({
  baselineDatasetId: dataset.id,
  assumptions: {
    revenueGrowth: 0.12,
    costInflation: 0.03,
    headcountChange: 15
  },
  projectionPeriod: 'FY2026'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert leadership when profitability drops below target
analytics.profitabilityCalculated(async ({ businessUnit, grossMargin, target }) => {
  if (grossMargin < target) {
    await notify({
      to: 'cfo',
      message: `${businessUnit} gross margin at ${(grossMargin * 100).toFixed(1)}% vs ${(target * 100).toFixed(1)}% target`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-generate quarterly report when data aggregation completes
analytics.dataAggregated(async ({ datasetId, period }) => {
  if (isQuarterEnd(period)) {
    await analytics.produceAnalyticalReport({
      datasetId,
      reportType: 'quarterly-business-review',
      distributeTo: ['executive-team', 'board-of-directors']
    })
  }
})
```
