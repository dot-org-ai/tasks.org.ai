# Analyze Budgetary or Accounting Data

> Business-as-Code definition for budgetary and accounting data analysis. Models the complete workflow from data extraction through variance analysis, reconciliation, and financial reporting.

## Overview

Budgetary and accounting data analysis involves examining general ledger entries, budget allocations, expenditure records, and revenue figures to assess financial performance and compliance. Analysts compare actual results against budgeted amounts, identify variances, trace discrepancies through journal entries, and prepare reports for management and regulatory bodies. This definition supports month-end close, annual budget review, audit preparation, and ongoing financial monitoring.

| BankOrLender | Evaluates financial data for credit and covenant compliance |
| BoardOfDirectors | Receives summarized financial performance reports for governance decisions |
| VendorOrSupplier | Generates invoices and payment records that flow into accounting data |

|-------|-------------|
| ledgerDataExtracted | General ledger data for a period has been pulled for analysis |
| variancesCalculated | Budget-to-actual variances have been computed |
| accountReconciled | An account reconciliation has been completed and balanced |
| expenditureClassified | A transaction has been assigned to a cost center and account code |
| discrepancyFlagged | An unexplained difference has been identified for investigation |
| trialBalancePrepared | A complete listing of account balances has been generated |
| varianceReportGenerated | A formatted variance report has been produced and distributed |
| reconciliationException | A reconciliation could not be balanced and requires manual review |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { analyzeBudgetaryAccountingData } from '@headlessly/analyze-budgetary-accounting-data'

const accounting = analyzeBudgetaryAccountingData()

// Extract Q1 ledger data for the marketing department
const ledgerData = await accounting.extractLedgerData({
  period: { start: '2026-01-01', end: '2026-03-31' },
  costCenter: 'marketing',
  accountRange: { from: '5000', to: '5999' }
})

// Calculate variances against budget
const variances = await accounting.calculateVariances({
  period: 'Q1-2026',
  costCenter: 'marketing',
  threshold: 0.10
})

// Generate the variance report
await accounting.generateVarianceReport({
  period: 'Q1-2026',
  costCenters: ['marketing', 'sales', 'engineering'],
  includeExplanations: true,
  distributeTo: ['controller', 'cfo']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert management when variances exceed threshold
accounting.variancesCalculated(async ({ costCenter, variances }) => {
  const significant = variances.filter(v => Math.abs(v.percentage) > 15)
  if (significant.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: `${costCenter}-manager`,
      message: `${significant.length} line items exceed 15% variance in ${costCenter}`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-escalate unresolved reconciliation exceptions
accounting.reconciliationException(async ({ accountId, amount, age }) => {
  if (age > 5) {
    await notify({
      to: 'controller',
      message: `Reconciliation exception on account ${accountId} ($${amount}) unresolved for ${age} days`
    })
  }
})
```
