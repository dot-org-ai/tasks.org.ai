## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { analyzeFinancialInformation } from '@headlessly/analyze-financial-information'

const finance = analyzeFinancialInformation()

// Ingest annual financial statements for a public company
const statements = await finance.ingestFinancialStatements({
  entityId: 'ACME-CORP',
  filingType: '10-K',
  period: 'FY2025'
})

// Compute key financial ratios
const ratios = await finance.computeFinancialRatios({
  entityId: 'ACME-CORP',
  period: 'FY2025',
  ratioSets: ['liquidity', 'leverage', 'profitability', 'efficiency']
})

// Perform DCF valuation
const valuation = await finance.performValuation({
  entityId: 'ACME-CORP',
  method: 'discounted-cash-flow',
  discountRate: 0.10,
  projectionYears: 5
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Trigger peer comparison when ratios are computed
finance.ratiosComputed(async ({ entityId, period }) => {
  await finance.comparePeers({
    entityId,
    period,
    peerGroup: 'same-industry-same-size'
  })
})

// Alert risk officer when credit assessment is negative
finance.creditworthinessAssessed(async ({ entityId, rating, riskLevel }) => {
  if (riskLevel === 'high' || riskLevel === 'very-high') {
    await notify({
      to: 'risk-officer',
      message: `Credit assessment for ${entityId}: ${rating} (${riskLevel} risk)`
    })
  }
})
```
