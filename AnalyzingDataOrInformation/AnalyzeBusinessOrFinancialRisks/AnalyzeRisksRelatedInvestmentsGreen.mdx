# Analyze Risks Related to Investments in Green Technology

> Business-as-Code definition for analyzing risks related to investments in green technology. Models the assessment of technology maturity, regulatory uncertainty, market adoption, supply chain dependencies, and financial return risks specific to renewable energy, clean transportation, carbon capture, and other sustainability-focused investments.

## Overview

Analyzing risks related to investments in green technology involves evaluating technology readiness levels, policy and subsidy volatility, market adoption uncertainty, supply chain concentration risks, and financial performance projections for investments in renewable energy, energy storage, electric vehicles, carbon markets, and sustainable materials. This definition provides actions for risk categorization, scenario modeling, due diligence assessment, and investment risk reporting. It supports ESG investment analysts, cleantech venture capitalists, corporate sustainability officers, and green bond underwriters.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { analyzeRisksRelatedInvestmentsGreen } from '@headlessly/analyze-risks-related-investments-green'

const analyst = analyzeRisksRelatedInvestmentsGreen()

// Assess technology and policy risks
const assessment = await analyst.assessTechnologyReadiness({
  technology: 'solid-state-battery-storage',
  company: 'greenpower-innovations',
  trlTarget: 7
})

await analyst.analyzePolicyRisk({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  jurisdictions: ['US-federal', 'EU', 'california'],
  policies: ['IRA-tax-credits', 'EU-green-deal', 'carbon-border-adjustment']
})

await analyst.forecastMarketAdoption({ assessmentId: assessment.id })
await analyst.mapSupplyChainRisks({ assessmentId: assessment.id })

// Model scenarios and conduct due diligence
await analyst.modelInvestmentScenarios({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  scenarios: ['base-case', 'subsidy-expiration', 'accelerated-adoption']
})
await analyst.conductDueDiligence({ assessmentId: assessment.id })
await analyst.generateRiskReport({ assessmentId: assessment.id })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on policy risk changes
analyst.policyRiskAnalyzed(async ({ assessmentId, jurisdiction, riskLevel, previousLevel }) => {
  if (riskLevel > previousLevel) {
    await notify({
      to: 'investment-committee',
      message: `Policy risk increased in ${jurisdiction}: ${previousLevel} to ${riskLevel}`
    })
  }
})

// Distribute due diligence reports
analyst.dueDiligenceConducted(async ({ assessmentId, reportId, technology }) => {
  await distribute({ reportId, recipients: ['portfolio-management', 'risk-committee', 'ESG-team'] })
})
```
