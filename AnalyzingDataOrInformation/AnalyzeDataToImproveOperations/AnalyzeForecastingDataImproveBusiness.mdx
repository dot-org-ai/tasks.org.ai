# Analyze Forecasting Data to Improve Business Decisions

> Business-as-Code definition for analyzing forecasting data to improve business decisions. Models the process of gathering historical and leading indicator data, applying statistical and machine learning forecasting methods, evaluating forecast accuracy, and translating projections into actionable business guidance.

## Overview

Analyzing forecasting data to improve business decisions involves collecting historical sales, financial, operational, and market data, generating demand, revenue, and resource forecasts using time-series analysis, regression modeling, and ensemble methods, then validating forecast accuracy and presenting scenario-based projections to executive leadership for strategic planning. This definition provides actions for data preparation, forecast generation, accuracy measurement, and decision-ready insight delivery. It supports business intelligence analysts, demand planners, financial planning teams, and strategic planning executives.

## Actors

| Actor | Description |

## Entities

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ForecastModel | A mathematical or machine learning model that generates future projections |
| HistoricalDataset | A curated set of past observations used to train forecasting models |
| ForecastOutput | A set of projected values for a specific metric and time horizon |
| AccuracyMetric | A measure of forecast quality such as MAPE, RMSE, or bias |
| ScenarioProjection | A forecast variant based on alternative assumptions about key drivers |
| LeadingIndicator | An external signal that provides advance notice of changes in business conditions |
| ForecastBrief | A summary of forecast findings and recommended business actions |

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| prepareHistoricalData | Collect, clean, and structure historical data for forecasting model input |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { analyzeForecastingDataImproveBusiness } from '@headlessly/analyze-forecasting-data-improve-business'

const forecaster = analyzeForecastingDataImproveBusiness()

// Prepare and select method
const forecast = await forecaster.prepareHistoricalData({
  metrics: ['monthly-revenue', 'unit-demand', 'customer-churn-rate'],
  period: { start: '2020-01-01', end: '2025-12-31' },
  sources: ['crm', 'erp', 'billing-system']
})

await forecaster.identifyLeadingIndicators({
  forecastId: forecast.id,
  candidates: ['gdp-growth', 'consumer-confidence-index', 'industry-pmi']
})

await forecaster.selectForecastingMethod({
  forecastId: forecast.id,
  candidates: ['arima', 'prophet', 'gradient-boosting-ensemble']
})

// Generate and validate
await forecaster.generateForecast({
  forecastId: forecast.id,
  horizon: '12-months',
  granularity: 'monthly'
})

await forecaster.measureForecastAccuracy({ forecastId: forecast.id })

// Scenario planning and delivery
await forecaster.modelForecastScenarios({
  forecastId: forecast.id,
  scenarios: ['baseline', 'recession', 'expansion']
})

await forecaster.deliverForecastBrief({ forecastId: forecast.id })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert when forecast accuracy degrades
forecaster.forecastAccuracyMeasured(async ({ forecastId, metrics }) => {
  if (metrics.mape > 15) {
    await notify({
      to: 'demand-planning-team',
      message: `Forecast MAPE at ${metrics.mape}% exceeds 15% threshold - model retraining recommended`
    })
  }
})

// Distribute forecast briefs to executive team
forecaster.forecastBriefDelivered(async ({ forecastId, briefId, topic }) => {
  await distribute({ briefId, recipients: ['CEO', 'CFO', 'VP-operations', 'VP-sales'] })
})
```
