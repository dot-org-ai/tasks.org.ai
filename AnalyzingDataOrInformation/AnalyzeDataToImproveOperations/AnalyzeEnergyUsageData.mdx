# Analyze Energy Usage Data

> Business-as-Code definition for analyzing energy usage data. Models the collection, normalization, and interpretation of electricity, gas, water, and fuel consumption data across facilities and operations to identify waste, optimize consumption patterns, and support sustainability and cost reduction goals.

## Overview

Analyzing energy usage data involves gathering consumption readings from utility meters, building management systems, and IoT sensors, normalizing data for weather and occupancy variables, identifying consumption patterns and anomalies, benchmarking against industry standards, and recommending efficiency improvements. This definition provides actions for data ingestion, baseline calculation, anomaly detection, and efficiency reporting. It supports energy managers, facilities directors, sustainability officers, and utility analysts.

## Actors

| Actor | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| UtilityCompany | Provides metered consumption data and rate schedules for electricity, gas, and water |
| BuildingManagementSystemVendor | Supplies real-time HVAC, lighting, and equipment monitoring data |
| EnergyServiceCompany | Conducts energy audits and implements efficiency retrofit projects |
| WeatherDataProvider | Delivers temperature, humidity, and degree-day data for consumption normalization |
| RegulatoryAuthority | Establishes energy reporting mandates and emissions reduction targets |
| IoTSensorManufacturer | Provides sub-metering and equipment-level consumption monitoring devices |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { analyzeEnergyUsageData } from '@headlessly/analyze-energy-usage-data'

const analyst = analyzeEnergyUsageData()

// Ingest and normalize
const analysis = await analyst.ingestConsumptionData({
  facilities: ['headquarters', 'manufacturing-plant-1', 'data-center-east'],
  sources: ['electricity', 'natural-gas', 'chilled-water'],
  period: { start: '2025-01-01', end: '2025-12-31' },
  granularity: '15-minute'
})

await analyst.normalizeForVariables({
  analysisId: analysis.id,
  variables: ['heating-degree-days', 'cooling-degree-days', 'occupancy-rate']
})

await analyst.calculateBaseline({ analysisId: analysis.id, referenceYear: 2024 })

// Detect and benchmark
await analyst.detectConsumptionAnomalies({ analysisId: analysis.id, threshold: 2.0 })
await analyst.benchmarkConsumption({
  analysisId: analysis.id,
  benchmark: 'energy-star-commercial'
})

// Analyze rates and report
await analyst.analyzeRateStructures({ analysisId: analysis.id })
await analyst.generateEnergyReport({ analysisId: analysis.id })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert facilities team on consumption anomalies
analyst.consumptionAnomaliesDetected(async ({ analysisId, anomalies }) => {
  const urgent = anomalies.filter(a => a.excessCostPerDay > 500)
  if (urgent.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'facilities-engineering',
      message: `${urgent.length} consumption anomalies detected costing over $500/day each`
    })
  }
})

// Distribute energy reports to stakeholders
analyst.energyReportGenerated(async ({ analysisId, reportId }) => {
  await distribute({ reportId, recipients: ['sustainability-officer', 'facilities-director', 'CFO'] })
})
```
