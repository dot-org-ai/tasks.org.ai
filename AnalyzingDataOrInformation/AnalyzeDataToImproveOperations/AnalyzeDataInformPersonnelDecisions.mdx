This definition provides actions for workforce data collection, talent analytics, compensation analysis, and personnel recommendation reporting. It supports HR directors, people analytics teams, compensation specialists, and talent acquisition managers.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { analyzeDataInformPersonnelDecisions } from '@headlessly/analyze-data-inform-personnel-decisions'

const analyst = analyzeDataInformPersonnelDecisions()

// Collect workforce data
const analysis = await analyst.collectWorkforceData({
  departments: ['engineering', 'sales', 'operations'],
  dataPoints: ['performance-ratings', 'compensation', 'tenure', 'engagement-scores'],
  period: { start: '2024-01-01', end: '2025-12-31' }
})

// Analyze trends and risks
await analyst.analyzePerformanceTrends({ analysisId: analysis.id })
await analyst.benchmarkCompensation({
  analysisId: analysis.id,
  surveys: ['radford-tech', 'mercer-general-industry']
})
await analyst.assessRetentionRisk({ analysisId: analysis.id })
await analyst.evaluateSkillsGaps({ analysisId: analysis.id })

// Model and report
await analyst.modelStaffingScenarios({
  analysisId: analysis.id,
  scenarios: ['10-percent-growth', 'flat-headcount', 'restructure']
})
await analyst.generatePersonnelReport({ analysisId: analysis.id })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert HR when high retention risk is detected
analyst.retentionRiskAssessed(async ({ analysisId, riskScores }) => {
  const highRisk = riskScores.filter(r => r.score > 0.75 && r.performanceRating >= 4)
  if (highRisk.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'hr-business-partners',
      message: `${highRisk.length} high-performing employees flagged as high retention risk`
    })
  }
})

// Notify compensation team of pay equity gaps
analyst.compensationBenchmarked(async ({ analysisId, benchmarkResults }) => {
  const belowMarket = benchmarkResults.filter(b => b.compaRatio < 0.90)
  if (belowMarket.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'compensation-team',
      message: `${belowMarket.length} roles are below 90% of market median - review recommended`
    })
  }
})
```
