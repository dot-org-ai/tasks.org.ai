# Analyze Operational or Research Data

> Business-as-Code definition for analyzing operational or research data. Models the application of quantitative methods including optimization, simulation, queueing theory, and statistical modeling to operational and research datasets in order to improve resource allocation, system design, and strategic decision-making.

## Overview

Analyzing operational or research data involves applying operations research techniques such as linear programming, discrete event simulation, regression analysis, and Monte Carlo methods to datasets from production, logistics, healthcare, defense, and research environments, then translating analytical results into actionable recommendations for system improvement. This definition provides actions for problem formulation, model development, solution analysis, and recommendation delivery. It supports operations research analysts, management scientists, systems engineers, and research directors.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { analyzeOperationalResearchData } from '@headlessly/analyze-operational-research-data'

const analyst = analyzeOperationalResearchData()

// Formulate and profile
const study = await analyst.formulateProblem({
  domain: 'logistics-network-design',
  objective: 'minimize-total-distribution-cost',
  constraints: ['service-level-98-percent', 'max-facilities-12', 'budget-cap-50M'],
  decisionVariables: ['facility-locations', 'allocation-volumes', 'transportation-modes']
})

await analyst.profileDataset({
  studyId: study.id,
  sources: ['shipment-history', 'facility-costs', 'demand-forecasts'],
  period: { start: '2022-01-01', end: '2025-12-31' }
})

// Build model and analyze
await analyst.buildOptimizationModel({
  studyId: study.id,
  technique: 'mixed-integer-linear-programming'
})

await analyst.performSensitivityAnalysis({
  studyId: study.id,
  parameters: ['demand-growth-rate', 'fuel-cost', 'facility-lease-cost']
})

// Validate and deliver
await analyst.validateResults({ studyId: study.id, method: 'historical-backtest' })
await analyst.deliverRecommendations({ studyId: study.id })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify stakeholders when recommendations are ready
analyst.recommendationsDelivered(async ({ studyId, reportId, domain }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'operations-leadership',
    message: `Operations research recommendations for ${domain} ready for review`
  })
})

// Alert on model validation failures
analyst.resultsValidated(async ({ studyId, validationScore, threshold }) => {
  if (validationScore < threshold) {
    await notify({
      to: 'analytics-team',
      message: `Model validation score ${validationScore} below threshold ${threshold} - review assumptions`
    })
  }
})
```
