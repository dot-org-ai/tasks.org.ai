# Analyze Chemical Compounds or Substances

> Business-as-Code definition for chemical compound and substance analysis. Models the analytical workflow from sample preparation through instrumental analysis, data interpretation, and compliance reporting.

## Overview

Chemical compound and substance analysis involves identifying, quantifying, and characterizing the composition and properties of materials using techniques such as mass spectrometry, spectroscopy, chromatography, and wet chemistry methods. This definition exposes actions for each stage of chemical analysis, events for laboratory automation, and searches for retrieving analytical data. It supports pharmaceutical development, environmental testing, materials science, and regulatory compliance applications.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { analyzeChemicalCompoundsSubstances } from '@headlessly/analyze-chemical-compounds-substances'

const chem = analyzeChemicalCompoundsSubstances()

// Register a water sample for heavy metals analysis
const sample = await chem.registerSample({
  clientId: 'ENV-CORP-042',
  matrixType: 'drinking-water',
  analytes: ['lead', 'arsenic', 'mercury', 'cadmium'],
  method: 'EPA-200.8'
})

// Perform ICP-MS analysis
const analysis = await chem.performAnalysis({
  sampleId: sample.id,
  instrument: 'icp-ms-02',
  method: 'EPA-200.8'
})

// Issue certificate of analysis
await chem.issueCertificate({
  sampleId: sample.id,
  analysisIds: [analysis.id],
  signedBy: 'Dr. Chen, Laboratory Director'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert client when results exceed regulatory limits
chem.analyteQuantified(async ({ sampleId, analyte, concentration, unit, regulatoryLimit }) => {
  if (concentration > regulatoryLimit) {
    await notify({
      to: 'client-contact',
      message: `${analyte} at ${concentration} ${unit} exceeds limit of ${regulatoryLimit} ${unit}`
    })
  }
})

// Schedule recalibration when calibration fails
chem.calibrationFailed(async ({ instrumentId, method }) => {
  await scheduleTask({
    type: 'instrument-maintenance',
    instrumentId,
    priority: 'high',
    reason: `Calibration failure on method ${method}`
  })
})
```
