## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { analyzeImpactLegalRegulatoryChanges } from '@headlessly/analyze-impact-legal-regulatory-changes'

const impact = analyzeImpactLegalRegulatoryChanges()

// Monitor a new data privacy regulation
const change = await impact.monitorChanges({
  jurisdiction: 'California',
  title: 'Consumer Privacy Rights Act 2026',
  effectiveDate: '2027-01-01',
  category: 'data-protection'
})

// Assess impact on affected business units
const assessment = await impact.assessImpact({
  changeId: change.id,
  scope: ['marketing', 'sales', 'customer-service']
})

// Estimate compliance costs
const costs = await impact.estimateCosts({
  changeId: change.id,
  categories: ['technology', 'training', 'legal', 'operational']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Automatically quantify risk when impact assessed
impact.impactAssessed(async ({ changeId, severity }) => {
  if (severity === 'high') {
    await impact.quantifyRisk({
      changeId,
      factors: ['financial', 'operational', 'reputational']
    })
  }
})

// Alert leadership on high-cost regulatory changes
impact.costsEstimated(async ({ changeId, totalCost }) => {
  if (totalCost > 1000000) {
    await impact.communicateFindings({
      changeId,
      recipients: ['ceo', 'cfo', 'general-counsel'],
      urgency: 'immediate'
    })
  }
})
```
