```typescript
import { evaluateApplicableLawsRegulationsDetermine } from '@headlessly/evaluate-applicable-laws-regulations-determine'

const evaluation = evaluateApplicableLawsRegulationsDetermine()

// Research laws for a new market entry
const laws = await evaluation.researchLaws({
  jurisdiction: 'Canada',
  industries: ['financial-services', 'technology'],
  topics: ['data-protection', 'consumer-protection', 'employment']
})

// Assess applicability of a specific regulation
const assessment = await evaluation.assessApplicability({

```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Map activities when law deemed applicable
evaluation.applicabilityAssessed(async ({ lawId, applicable }) => {
  if (applicable) {
    await evaluation.mapActivities({
      lawId,
      scope: 'all-business-units'
    })
  }
})

// Assign ownership after plan development
evaluation.planDeveloped(async ({ planId, requirements }) => {
  for (const req of requirements) {
    await evaluation.assignOwnership({
      planId,
      requirementId: req.id,
      owner: req.suggestedOwner,
      deadline: req.implementationDeadline
    })
