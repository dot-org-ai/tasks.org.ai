## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { analyzeEnvironmentalRegulationsEnsureOrganizational } from '@headlessly/analyze-environmental-regulations-ensure-organizational'

const compliance = analyzeEnvironmentalRegulationsEnsureOrganizational()

// Track a new air quality regulation
const regulation = await compliance.trackRegulation({
  jurisdiction: 'US-EPA',
  title: 'Clean Air Act Amendment 2026',
  effectiveDate: '2026-07-01',
  applicableFacilities: ['plant-001', 'plant-003']
})

// Assess compliance at a facility
const assessment = await compliance.assessCompliance({
  facilityId: 'plant-001',
  regulationId: regulation.id,
  assessmentDate: '2026-06-15'
})

// Generate compliance report for submission
const report = await compliance.generateReport({
  facilityId: 'plant-001',
  reportingPeriod: 'Q2-2026',
  regulationIds: [regulation.id]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Automatically create remediation plan when gaps identified
compliance.gapsIdentified(async ({ assessmentId, violations }) => {
  if (violations.length > 0) {
    await compliance.createRemediationPlan({
      assessmentId,
      violations,
      targetCompletionDate: addDays(new Date(), 90)
    })
  }
})

// Schedule audit after remediation plan completion
compliance.remediationPlanned(async ({ planId, facilityId }) => {
  await compliance.scheduleAudit({
    facilityId,
    auditType: 'post-remediation',
    requestedDate: addDays(new Date(), 30)
  })
})
```
