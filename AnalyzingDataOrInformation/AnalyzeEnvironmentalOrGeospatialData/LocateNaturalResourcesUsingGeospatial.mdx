# Locate Natural Resources Using Geospatial or Other Environmental Data

> Business-as-Code definition for locating natural resources using geospatial and environmental data. Models the analysis of satellite imagery, geological surveys, GIS layers, and remote sensing data to identify mineral deposits, water sources, timber stands, and energy resources.

## Overview

Locating natural resources using geospatial or other environmental data involves analyzing satellite imagery, aerial photography, geological surveys, GIS datasets, and remote sensing outputs to identify the location, extent, and accessibility of mineral deposits, groundwater aquifers, timber stands, petroleum reserves, and renewable energy sites. This definition provides actions for data acquisition, spatial analysis, resource mapping, and feasibility assessment. It supports geologists, GIS analysts, natural resource managers, and exploration companies.

## Actors

| Actor | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ExplorationCompany | Commissions resource location studies for extraction planning |
| GeologicalSurvey | Provides regional geological data and maps |
| SatelliteImageryProvider | Supplies remote sensing and satellite data for analysis |
| LandManagementAgency | Manages public lands and grants resource exploration permits |
| EnvironmentalConsultant | Assesses ecological constraints on resource access |

## Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| GISAnalyst | Processes and analyzes geospatial data to identify resource indicators |

| ExplorationManager | Directs resource location activities and prioritizes target areas |

## Entities

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| GeospatialDataset | A collection of georeferenced data layers for analysis |
| ResourceIndicator | A geophysical or geological signature suggesting resource presence |
| SpatialAnalysisResult | The output of GIS processing identifying potential resource locations |
| ResourceMap | A geographic visualization of identified natural resource locations |
| FeasibilityAssessment | An evaluation of the viability of accessing an identified resource |
| ExplorationTarget | A prioritized location recommended for field verification |
| RemoteSensingImage | Satellite or aerial imagery processed for resource analysis |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { locateNaturalResourcesUsingGeospatial } from '@headlessly/locate-natural-resources-using-geospatial'

const locator = locateNaturalResourcesUsingGeospatial()

// Acquire geospatial data for a region
const analysis = await locator.acquireGeospatialData({
  region: 'appalachian-basin-sector-7',
  dataSources: ['landsat-9', 'usgs-geological-maps', 'state-well-logs'],
  resourceType: 'natural-gas'
})

// Process and analyze
await locator.processRemoteSensing({ analysisId: analysis.id })
await locator.performSpatialAnalysis({ analysisId: analysis.id })
await locator.mapResourceLocations({ analysisId: analysis.id })

// Assess feasibility and prioritize
await locator.assessFeasibility({ analysisId: analysis.id })
await locator.prioritizeTargets({ analysisId: analysis.id })
await locator.generateExplorationReport({ analysisId: analysis.id })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify exploration team of high-priority targets
locator.targetsPrioritized(async ({ analysisId, topTargets }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'exploration-team',
    message: `${topTargets.length} high-priority targets identified for field verification`
  })
})

// Archive completed analyses
locator.explorationReportGenerated(async ({ analysisId, reportId }) => {
  await archive({ reportId, repository: 'resource-exploration-library' })
})
```
