# Analyze Geological Samples

> Business-as-Code definition for analyzing geological samples. Models the laboratory examination of rock cores, soil specimens, mineral samples, and sediment cores using petrographic, geochemical, and mineralogical techniques to determine composition, age, and resource potential.

## Overview

Analyzing geological samples involves examining rock cores, soil specimens, mineral samples, and sediment cores through petrographic microscopy, X-ray diffraction, geochemical assay, and radiometric dating to determine mineral composition, formation age, porosity, permeability, and economic potential. This definition provides actions for sample registration, laboratory analysis, data interpretation, and reporting. It supports geologists, petrographers, mining engineers, and petroleum geoscientists.

## Actors

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { analyzeGeologicalSamples } from '@headlessly/analyze-geological-samples'

const analyzer = analyzeGeologicalSamples()

// Register a drill core sample
const sample = await analyzer.registerSample({
  sampleId: 'DDH-2026-047-C12',
  type: 'drill-core',
  location: { latitude: 46.8721, longitude: -111.0349 },
  depth: { from: 145.5, to: 147.0, unit: 'meters' },
  rockType: 'quartz-monzonite'
})

// Perform laboratory analyses
await analyzer.prepareThinSection({ sampleId: sample.id })
await analyzer.performGeochemicalAssay({
  sampleId: sample.id,
  method: 'ICP-MS',
  elements: ['Au', 'Ag', 'Cu', 'Mo', 'As']
})
await analyzer.conductXRayDiffraction({ sampleId: sample.id })

// Interpret and report
await analyzer.interpretResults({ sampleId: sample.id })
await analyzer.generateAnalysisReport({ sampleId: sample.id })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert exploration team on significant assay results
analyzer.geochemicalAssayCompleted(async ({ sampleId, results }) => {
  if (results.Au > 1.0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'exploration-manager',
      message: `High gold assay: ${results.Au} g/t in sample ${sampleId}`
    })
  }
})

// Archive reports to project database
analyzer.analysisReportGenerated(async ({ sampleId, reportId, projectId }) => {
  await archive({ reportId, projectId, repository: 'geological-analysis-library' })
})
```
