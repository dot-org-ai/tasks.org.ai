# Analyze Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Data for Use in Green Applications

> Business-as-Code definition for analyzing GIS data for green applications. Models the use of spatial analysis, land cover classification, solar irradiance mapping, and environmental overlay techniques to support renewable energy siting, green infrastructure planning, and sustainable development decisions.

## Overview

Analyzing GIS data for use in green applications involves processing geospatial datasets including land cover maps, solar radiation models, wind resource assessments, green infrastructure inventories, and environmental constraint layers to support renewable energy project siting, urban greening strategies, and sustainable land use planning. This definition provides actions for data layer preparation, spatial suitability analysis, environmental overlay, and green application reporting. It supports GIS specialists, sustainability planners, renewable energy developers, and urban ecologists.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { analyzeGeographicInformationSystemsGis } from '@headlessly/analyze-geographic-information-systems-gis'

const analyst = analyzeGeographicInformationSystemsGis()

// Prepare data layers for a solar farm siting study
const analysis = await analyst.prepareDataLayers({
  projectId: 'solar-farm-siting-county-12',
  layers: ['land-cover-NLCD', 'digital-elevation-model', 'solar-irradiance-NSRDB', 'wetlands-NWI', 'transmission-lines'],
  boundingBox: { north: 35.2, south: 34.8, east: -82.0, west: -82.5 }
})

// Analyze and identify sites
await analyst.classifyLandCover({ analysisId: analysis.id })
await analyst.modelSolarResource({ analysisId: analysis.id })
await analyst.performSuitabilityAnalysis({
  analysisId: analysis.id,
  criteria: { slope: 0.3, solarIrradiance: 0.4, landCover: 0.2, proximity: 0.1 }
})
await analyst.overlayEnvironmentalConstraints({ analysisId: analysis.id })
await analyst.identifyOptimalSites({ analysisId: analysis.id, maxSites: 5 })

// Generate report
await analyst.generateGreenReport({ analysisId: analysis.id })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify developer of optimal sites
analyst.optimalSitesIdentified(async ({ analysisId, sites, projectId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'renewable-energy-development',
    message: `${sites.length} optimal sites identified for ${projectId}`
  })
})

// Archive completed analyses
analyst.greenReportGenerated(async ({ analysisId, reportId }) => {
  await archive({ reportId, repository: 'green-gis-library' })
})
```
