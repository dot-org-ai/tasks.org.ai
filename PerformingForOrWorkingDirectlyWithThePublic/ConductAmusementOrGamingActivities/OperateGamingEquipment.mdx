## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { operateGamingEquipment } from '@headlessly/operate-gaming-equipment'

const equipment = operateGamingEquipment()

// Activate a gaming machine
await equipment.activateEquipment({
  machineId: 'slot-2847',
  location: 'Floor B - Row 12',
  type: 'Video Slots'
})

// Configure payout settings
await equipment.configurePayoutSettings({
  machineId: 'slot-2847',
  denomination: 0.25,
  payoutPercentage: 92.5,
  maxPayout: 10000
})

// Record end-of-shift meter readings
await equipment.recordMeterReading({
  machineId: 'slot-2847',
  coinIn: 48250,
  coinOut: 44631,
  jackpotsPaid: 0,
  gamesPlayed: 19300
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert technician on fault
equipment.faultReported(async ({ machineId, errorCode, severity }) => {
  if (severity === 'critical') {
    await equipment.deactivateEquipment({ machineId })
    await notify({
      to: 'floor-technician',
      message: `Critical fault ${errorCode} on machine ${machineId}. Machine deactivated.`
    })
  }
})

// Compliance check on activation
equipment.equipmentActivated(async ({ machineId }) => {
  await equipment.verifyCertification({ machineId })
})
```
