## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { answerCustomerQuestionsAboutGoods } from '@headlessly/answer-customer-questions-about-goods'

const questions = answerCustomerQuestionsAboutGoods()

// Receive and classify a product inquiry
const inquiry = await questions.receiveInquiry({
  channel: 'live-chat',
  customer: 'cust-78432',
  question: 'What is the battery life of the ProTech X500 laptop and does it support USB-C charging?',
  product: 'protech-x500'
})

const classified = await questions.classifyQuestion({
  inquiryId: inquiry.id,
  category: 'product-specifications',
  complexity: 'standard',
  topics: ['battery-life', 'charging-compatibility']
})

// Research and deliver answer
const answer = await questions.researchAnswer({
  inquiryId: inquiry.id,
  sources: ['product-catalog', 'manufacturer-specs', 'knowledge-base'],
  productId: 'protech-x500'
})

await questions.deliverResponse({

// Auto-escalate unanswered questions after timeout
questions.inquiryReceived(async ({ inquiryId, complexity, timestamp }) => {
  await scheduleReminder({
    triggerDate: addMinutes(timestamp, complexity === 'standard' ? 15 : 5),
    action: 'escalateToSpecialist',
    inquiryId,
    reason: 'response-time-exceeded'
  })
})

// Update knowledge base when new questions surface frequently
questions.feedbackCollected(async ({ inquiryId, topic, satisfactionScore }) => {
  if (satisfactionScore < 3) {
    await notify({
      to: 'knowledge-manager',
      message: `Low satisfaction on ${topic} inquiry ${inquiryId}. Knowledge base entry may need improvement.`
    })
  }
})
```
