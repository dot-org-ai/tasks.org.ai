## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { resolveCustomerComplaintsProblems } from '@headlessly/resolve-customer-complaints-problems'

const resolve = resolveCustomerComplaintsProblems()

// Diagnose a reported issue
const diagnosis = await resolve.diagnoseIssue({
  caseId: 'case-9021',
  symptoms: ['screen-flickering', 'random-shutdowns'],
  product: 'laptop-model-x15'
})

// Determine and apply the remedy
const remedy = await resolve.determineRemedy({
  diagnosisId: diagnosis.id,
  options: ['replacement', 'repair', 'refund']
})

await resolve.initiateReturn({
  caseId: 'case-9021',
  remedyType: 'replacement',
  shippingLabel: true
})

// Confirm the resolution with the customer
await resolve.confirmResolution({
  caseId: 'case-9021',
  method: 'phone-callback'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-initiate return for defective product diagnoses
resolve.issueDiagnosed(async ({ caseId, rootCause }) => {
  if (rootCause === 'manufacturing-defect') {
    await resolve.initiateReturn({ caseId, remedyType: 'replacement' })
  }
})

// Alert product team on pattern detection
resolve.patternsAnalyzed(async ({ product, issueType, frequency }) => {
  if (frequency > 50) {
    await notify({
      to: 'product-quality-team',
      message: `Recurring ${issueType} issue on ${product}: ${frequency} cases this month`
    })
  }
})
```
