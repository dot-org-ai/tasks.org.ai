### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { correspondCustomersAnswerQuestionsResolve } from '@headlessly/correspond-customers-answer-questions-resolve'

const correspondence = correspondCustomersAnswerQuestionsResolve()

// Receive and categorize an inbound email
const message = await correspondence.receiveCorrespondence({
  channel: 'email',
  customer: 'cust-56201',
  subject: 'Question about warranty coverage for Model Z100',
  body: 'I purchased a Z100 unit six months ago and the display is flickering. Is this covered under warranty?',
  attachments: ['purchase-receipt.pdf', 'video-of-issue.mp4']
})

await correspondence.categorizeInquiry({
  messageId: message.id,
  topic: 'warranty-inquiry',
  product: 'model-z100',
  urgency: 'standard',
  requiresExpertise: false
})

// Draft and send response
const draft = await correspondence.draftResponse({
  messageId: message.id,
  template: 'warranty-coverage-response',
  customFields: {
    productName: 'Model Z100',
    warrantyPeriod: '12-months',
    nextSteps: 'Submit a warranty claim through our service portal'
  }
})

await correspondence.reviewResponse({ draftId: draft.id, reviewer: 'quality-reviewer' })
await correspondence.sendResponse({ draftId: draft.id })
```

correspondence.correspondenceReceived(async ({ messageId, urgency, timestamp }) => {
  const slaHours = urgency === 'high' ? 4 : 24
  await scheduleReminder({
    triggerDate: addHours(timestamp, slaHours - 1),
    to: 'ticket-manager',
    message: `Correspondence ${messageId} approaching ${slaHours}-hour SLA deadline`
  })
})

// Auto-archive resolved threads
correspondence.responseSent(async ({ threadId, responseCount, customerConfirmed }) => {
  if (customerConfirmed === 'satisfied') {
    await correspondence.archiveCorrespondence({
      threadId,
      resolution: 'customer-confirmed-satisfied',
      totalResponses: responseCount
    })
  }
})
```
