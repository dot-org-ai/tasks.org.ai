## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { respondCustomerProblemsComplaints } from '@headlessly/respond-customer-problems-complaints'

const support = respondCustomerProblemsComplaints()

// Receive a complaint
const complaint = await support.receiveComplaint({
  customerId: 'cust-7734',
  channel: 'phone',
  product: 'wireless-router-x200',
  description: 'Device overheating and intermittent connectivity loss',
  severity: 'high'
})

// Investigate and propose resolution
await support.investigateCause({
  complaintId: complaint.id,
  findings: 'firmware-bug causing thermal management failure'
})

await support.proposeResolution({
  complaintId: complaint.id,
  resolution: 'firmware-update-and-replacement',
  compensation: { type: 'replacement', value: 89.99 }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-escalate high-severity complaints
support.complaintReceived(async ({ complaintId, severity }) => {
  if (severity === 'critical') {
    await support.escalateCase({
      complaintId,
      reason: 'critical-severity-auto-escalation'
    })
  }
})

// Send satisfaction survey after case closure
support.caseClosed(async ({ complaintId, customerId }) => {
  await sendSurvey({
    customerId,
    subject: 'How did we handle your recent issue?',
    caseRef: complaintId
  })
})
```
