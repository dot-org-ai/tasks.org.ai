## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { respondCustomerInquiries } from '@headlessly/respond-customer-inquiries'

const inquiries = respondCustomerInquiries()

// Receive and classify an inquiry
const inquiry = await inquiries.receiveInquiry({
  customerId: 'cust-4412',
  channel: 'live-chat',
  question: 'What are the return policy terms for electronics?'
})

await inquiries.classifyInquiry({
  inquiryId: inquiry.id,
  topic: 'return-policy',
  product: 'electronics',
  urgency: 'normal'
})

// Search knowledge base and deliver response
const articles = await inquiries.searchKnowledge({

})

await inquiries.deliverResponse({
  inquiryId: inquiry.id,
  content: articles[0].summary,

```typescript
// Auto-suggest knowledge articles on inquiry receipt
inquiries.inquiryClassified(async ({ inquiryId, topic }) => {
  const suggestions = await inquiries.searchKnowledge({ topic })
  await attachSuggestions({ inquiryId, articles: suggestions })
})

// Flag low satisfaction responses for review
inquiries.feedbackCollected(async ({ inquiryId, rating, agentId }) => {
  if (rating <= 2) {
    await notify({
      to: 'quality-reviewer',
      message: `Low satisfaction rating on inquiry ${inquiryId} by agent ${agentId}`
    })
  }
})
```
