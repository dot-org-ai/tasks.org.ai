### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { communicateCustomersResolveComplaintsEnsure } from '@headlessly/communicate-customers-resolve-complaints-ensure'

const comms = communicateCustomersResolveComplaintsEnsure()

// Acknowledge an incoming complaint
const complaint = await comms.acknowledgeComplaint({
  customer: 'cust-34210',
  channel: 'email',
  category: 'product-defect',
  description: 'Received damaged packaging and product with cosmetic scratches',
  orderId: 'ord-98712',
  responseTimePromise: '24-hours'
})

// Investigate and offer resolution
await comms.investigateIssue({
  caseId: complaint.id,
  departments: ['fulfillment-center', 'quality-assurance'],
  evidenceRequested: ['shipping-photos', 'packaging-inspection-log']
})

await comms.offerResolution({
  caseId: complaint.id,

// Auto-escalate complaints from high-value customers
comms.complaintAcknowledged(async ({ caseId, customerId }) => {
  const customerValue = await getCustomerLifetimeValue(customerId)
  if (customerValue > 10000) {
    await comms.escalateComplaint({
      caseId,
      reason: 'high-value-customer',
      assignTo: 'escalation-manager'
    })
  }
})

// Track satisfaction trends and alert on declining scores
comms.surveyReceived(async ({ customerId, score, category }) => {
  if (score <= 2) {
    await notify({
      to: 'satisfaction-analyst',
      message: `Low satisfaction score (${score}/5) from ${customerId} in category ${category}`
    })
  }
})
```
