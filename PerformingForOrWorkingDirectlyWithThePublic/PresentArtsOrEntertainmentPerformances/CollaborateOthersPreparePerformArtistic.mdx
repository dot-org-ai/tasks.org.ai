## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { collaborateOthersPreparePerformArtistic } from '@headlessly/collaborate-others-prepare-perform-artistic'

const productions = collaborateOthersPreparePerformArtistic()

// Assign roles for a new production
await productions.assignRoles({
  productionId: 'prod-hamlet-2026',
  assignments: [
    { performerId: 'perf-001', role: 'Hamlet' },
    { performerId: 'perf-002', role: 'Ophelia' },
    { performerId: 'perf-003', role: 'Claudius' }
  ]
})

// Schedule a rehearsal session
const rehearsal = await productions.scheduleRehearsal({
  productionId: 'prod-hamlet-2026',
  date: '2026-03-15',
  startTime: '10:00',
  endTime: '14:00',
  location: 'Main Stage',
  participants: ['perf-001', 'perf-002', 'perf-003'],
  objective: 'Act III blocking'
})

// Conduct a run-through and incorporate feedback
await productions.conductRunThrough({
  productionId: 'prod-hamlet-2026',
  type: 'full',
  rehearsalId: rehearsal.id
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify cast when rehearsal is scheduled
productions.rehearsalScheduled(async ({ productionId, date, participants }) => {
  for (const participant of participants) {
    await notify({
      to: participant,
      message: `Rehearsal scheduled for ${date} on production ${productionId}`
    })
  }
})

// Escalate unresolved conflicts
productions.conflictDetected(async ({ productionId, type, details }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'stage-manager',
    message: `${type} conflict on ${productionId}: ${details}`
  })
})
```
