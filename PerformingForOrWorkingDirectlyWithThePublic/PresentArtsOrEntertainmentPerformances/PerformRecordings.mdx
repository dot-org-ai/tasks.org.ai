## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { performRecordings } from '@headlessly/perform-recordings'

const recordings = performRecordings()

// Schedule a recording session
const session = await recordings.scheduleSession({
  studio: 'Studio A',
  date: '2026-04-10',
  startTime: '09:00',
  endTime: '17:00',
  performers: ['perf-001', 'perf-002'],
  project: 'Album - Resonance'
})

// Capture a take
const take = await recordings.captureTake({
  sessionId: session.id,
  segment: 'Track 3 - Verse 1',
  takeNumber: 2
})

// Review and select the best take
await recordings.reviewPlayback({ takeId: take.id })
await recordings.selectTake({ takeId: take.id, segment: 'Track 3 - Verse 1' })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify engineer when material is ready
recordings.materialPrepared(async ({ sessionId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'recording-engineer',
    message: `Material prepared for session ${sessionId}. Equipment check recommended.`
  })
})

// Archive and distribute approved master
recordings.masterApproved(async ({ masterId, project }) => {
  await archiveRecording({ masterId })
  await notify({
    to: 'label-distribution',
    message: `Master approved for ${project}. Ready for distribution.`
  })
})
```
