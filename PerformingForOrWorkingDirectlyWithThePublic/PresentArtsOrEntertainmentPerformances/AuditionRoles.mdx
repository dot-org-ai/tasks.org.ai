### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { auditionRoles } from '@headlessly/audition-roles'

const auditions = auditionRoles()

// Discover matching audition opportunities
const calls = await auditions.discoverOpportunities({
  performerType: 'actor',
  genres: ['drama', 'comedy'],
  location: 'New York',
  unionStatus: 'SAG-AFTRA'
})

// Submit an application
await auditions.submitApplication({
  auditionCallId: calls[0].id,
  headshot: '/media/headshot-2026.jpg',
  resume: '/media/resume.pdf',
  demoReel: '/media/reel-dramatic.mp4'

await auditions.respondToCallback({
  callbackId: 'cb-9921',
  confirmed: true,
  preparedMaterial: ['monologue-hamlet', 'cold-read']

// Alert performer and agent when a callback is received
auditions.callbackReceived(async ({ performerId, productionName, callbackDate }) => {
  const agent = await getTalentAgent(performerId)
  await notify({
    to: [performerId, agent.email],
    message: `Callback for ${productionName} scheduled for ${callbackDate}`
  })
})

// Auto-track new audition opportunities matching profile
auditions.opportunityDiscovered(async ({ auditionCallId, roleName, deadline }) => {
  await auditions.prepareMaterial({
    auditionCallId,
    roleName,
    deadline,
    status: 'pending-review'
  })
})
```
