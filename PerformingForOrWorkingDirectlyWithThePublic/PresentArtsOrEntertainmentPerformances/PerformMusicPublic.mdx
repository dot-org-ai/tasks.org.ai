### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { performMusicPublic } from '@headlessly/perform-music-public'

const music = performMusicPublic()

// Book a performance
const engagement = await music.bookPerformance({
  venue: 'Blue Note Jazz Club',
  date: '2026-06-14',
  showTime: '20:00',
  fee: 5000,
  performers: ['musician-001', 'musician-002', 'musician-003']

// Trigger sound check reminder before show
music.performanceBooked(async ({ engagementId, date, venue }) => {
  await scheduleReminder({
    time: `${date}T16:00`,
    to: 'sound-engineer',
    message: `Sound check for ${venue} performance`
  })
})

// Auto-log after each performance
music.performanceExecuted(async ({ engagementId }) => {
  await music.logPerformance({ engagementId, timestamp: new Date().toISOString() })
})
```
