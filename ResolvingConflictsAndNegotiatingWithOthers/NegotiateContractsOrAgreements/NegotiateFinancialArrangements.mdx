## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { negotiateFinancialArrangements } from '@headlessly/negotiate-financial-arrangements'

const finance = negotiateFinancialArrangements()

// Assess capital needs for expansion
const needs = await finance.assessCapitalNeeds({
  purpose: 'facility-expansion',
  amount: 5000000,
  timing: 'Q2-2026',
  preferredStructure: 'term-loan',
  collateral: ['commercial-property', 'equipment']
})

// Solicit and evaluate offers
const offers = await finance.solicitOffers({
  requestId: needs.id,
  lenders: ['first-national-bank', 'regional-credit-union', 'capital-one-commercial'],
  responseDeadline: '2026-03-20'
})

// Negotiate and execute
await finance.negotiateRates({
  offerId: offers.preferred.id,
  targetRate: 5.25,
  feeWaivers: ['origination-fee'],
  term: '7-years'
})

await finance.executeAgreement({
  offerId: offers.preferred.id,
  signatories: ['cfo', 'board-chair'],
  closingDate: '2026-04-01'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-monitor covenants after agreement execution
finance.agreementExecuted(async ({ agreementId, covenants }) => {
  await scheduleRecurring({
    action: 'monitorCovenants',
    agreementId,
    metrics: covenants.map(c => c.metric),
    frequency: 'quarterly'
  })
})

// Alert treasury on approaching covenant thresholds
finance.covenantsMonitored(async ({ agreementId, metric, current, threshold }) => {
  if (current / threshold > 0.9) {
    await notify({
      to: 'treasury-manager',
      message: `Covenant ${metric} at ${Math.round(current / threshold * 100)}% of threshold on agreement ${agreementId}`
    })
  }
})
```
