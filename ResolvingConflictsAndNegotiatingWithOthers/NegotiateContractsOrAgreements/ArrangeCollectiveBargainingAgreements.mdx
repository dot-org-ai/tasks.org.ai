const bargaining = arrangeCollectiveBargainingAgreements()

// Analyze the expiring contract
const analysis = await bargaining.analyzeContract({
  agreementId: 'cba-2023-local-42',
  expirationDate: '2026-06-30',
  focusAreas: ['wages', 'healthcare-benefits', 'scheduling-flexibility']

    { topic: 'healthcare', position: 'maintain-current-plan-with-cost-sharing' },

      to: 'federal-mediator',
      message: `Bargaining impasse after ${sessionsCount} sessions. Mediation requested.`
