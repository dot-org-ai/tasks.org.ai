## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { negotiateServices } from '@headlessly/negotiate-services'

const services = negotiateServices()

// Assess needs for office cleaning services
const needs = await services.assessServiceNeeds({
  category: 'facilities-management',
  serviceType: 'commercial-cleaning',
  locations: ['main-office', 'satellite-office-north'],
  frequency: 'daily',
  specialRequirements: ['green-certified-products', 'after-hours-service']
})

// Source providers and request quotes
const providers = await services.sourceProviders({
  needsId: needs.id,
  certifications: ['issa-cims-certified'],
  minimumRating: 4.2
})

const quotes = await services.requestQuotes({
  needsId: needs.id,
  providers: providers.qualified.map(p => p.id),
  responseDeadline: '2026-03-20'
})

// Negotiate and execute
await services.negotiateTerms({
  quoteId: quotes.bestValue.id,
  proposedRate: { monthly: 8500, includesSupplies: true },
  term: '24-months',
  performanceReview: 'quarterly'
})

await services.executeAgreement({
  quoteId: quotes.bestValue.id,
  startDate: '2026-05-01',
  renewalOption: 'auto-renew-12-months'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Schedule performance reviews after agreement execution
services.agreementExecuted(async ({ agreementId, vendorId, performanceReview }) => {
  await scheduleRecurring({
    action: 'compareOffers',
    agreementId,
    vendorId,
    frequency: performanceReview,
    type: 'quality-assessment'
  })
})

// Alert on approaching contract renewals
services.termsNegotiated(async ({ agreementId, expirationDate }) => {
  await scheduleReminder({
    triggerDate: subtractDays(expirationDate, 90),
    to: 'category-manager',
    message: `Service agreement ${agreementId} renewal window opens in 90 days. Begin market assessment.`
  })
})
```
