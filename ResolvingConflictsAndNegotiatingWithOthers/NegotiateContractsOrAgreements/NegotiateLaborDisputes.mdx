## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { negotiateLaborDisputes } from '@headlessly/negotiate-labor-disputes'

const labor = negotiateLaborDisputes()

// Assess an ongoing labor dispute
const dispute = await labor.assessDispute({
  employer: 'metro-transit-authority',
  union: 'transit-workers-local-100',
  issues: ['overtime-pay-violations', 'unsafe-working-conditions'],
  affectedEmployees: 340
})

// Conduct mediation
await labor.conductMediation({
  disputeId: dispute.id,
  mediator: 'federal-mediation-service',
  date: '2026-03-10',
  agenda: ['overtime-calculation-method', 'safety-equipment-upgrades']
})

// Propose a settlement
await labor.proposeSettlement({
  disputeId: dispute.id,
  terms: {
    backPay: 450000,
    policyChanges: ['revised-overtime-calculation', 'monthly-safety-inspections'],
    implementationDate: '2026-04-01'
  }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-escalate to arbitration after failed mediation attempts
labor.mediationConducted(async ({ disputeId, outcome, attemptCount }) => {
  if (outcome === 'no-agreement' && attemptCount >= 3) {
    await labor.escalateToArbitration({
      disputeId,
      panel: 'regional-arbitration-board',
      unresolvedIssues: 'all'
    })
  }
})

// Monitor compliance after settlement
labor.settlementExecuted(async ({ disputeId, terms, implementationDate }) => {
  await scheduleRecurring({
    action: 'monitorCompliance',
    disputeId,
    startDate: implementationDate,
    frequency: 'monthly',
    duration: '12-months'
  })
})
```
