## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { negotiatePurchasesContracts } from '@headlessly/negotiate-purchases-contracts'

const procurement = negotiatePurchasesContracts()

// Define requirements for office furniture
const req = await procurement.defineRequirements({
  category: 'office-furniture',
  items: ['standing-desks', 'ergonomic-chairs', 'conference-tables'],
  quantity: 150,
  budget: 75000,
  deliveryBy: '2026-04-30'
})

// Solicit and evaluate bids
await procurement.solicitBids({
  requirementId: req.id,
  vendors: ['furniture-co', 'office-supply-inc', 'ergo-works']
})

const evaluation = await procurement.evaluateBids({
  requirementId: req.id,
  criteria: ['price', 'quality', 'delivery-timeline', 'warranty']
})

// Award and execute
await procurement.awardContract({
  requirementId: req.id,
  vendorId: evaluation.topBid.vendorId
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify stakeholder when contract is awarded
procurement.contractAwarded(async ({ vendorId, requirementId, value }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'requesting-department',
    message: `Contract awarded to ${vendorId} for $${value}`
  })
})

// Alert legal on high-value contracts
procurement.contractExecuted(async ({ contractId, value }) => {
  if (value > 50000) {
    await notify({
      to: 'legal-counsel',
      message: `High-value contract ${contractId} executed: $${value}`
    })
  }
})
```
