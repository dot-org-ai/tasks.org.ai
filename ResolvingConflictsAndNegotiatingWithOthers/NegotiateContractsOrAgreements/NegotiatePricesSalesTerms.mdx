## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { negotiatePricesSalesTerms } from '@headlessly/negotiate-prices-sales-terms'

const pricing = negotiatePricesSalesTerms()

// Research market pricing for raw materials
const benchmarks = await pricing.researchMarketPricing({
  productCategory: 'industrial-steel-coils',
  region: 'midwest-us',
  sources: ['metals-weekly', 'industry-price-index', 'recent-rfq-responses']
})

// Prepare and present a pricing proposal
const position = await pricing.preparePosition({
  benchmarkId: benchmarks.id,
  targetPrice: 1850,
  walkAwayPrice: 2100,
  volumeCommitment: { quantity: 500, unit: 'tons', period: 'quarterly' }
})

await pricing.presentProposal({
  positionId: position.id,
  counterparty: 'midwest-steel-supply',
  validUntil: '2026-04-15'
})

// Finalize after successful negotiation
await pricing.finalizeTerms({
  proposalId: position.proposalId,
  agreedPrice: 1925,
  paymentTerms: 'net-45',
  effectiveDate: '2026-05-01',
  duration: '12-months'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert when counteroffers deviate significantly from targets
pricing.counterofferEvaluated(async ({ proposalId, offeredPrice, targetPrice }) => {
  const deviation = Math.abs((offeredPrice - targetPrice) / targetPrice) * 100
  if (deviation > 20) {
    await notify({
      to: 'procurement-manager',
      message: `Counteroffer on ${proposalId} deviates ${Math.round(deviation)}% from target price`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-renew expiring agreements at favorable terms
pricing.termsFinalized(async ({ agreementId, expirationDate, agreedPrice }) => {
  await scheduleReminder({
    action: 'researchMarketPricing',
    agreementId,
    triggerDate: subtractDays(expirationDate, 90),
    note: `Renewal negotiation needed. Current price: ${agreedPrice}`
  })
})
```
