# Negotiate Contracts with Clients or Service Providers

> Business-as-Code definition for client and service provider contract negotiation. Models the process of defining service requirements, evaluating provider capabilities, negotiating scope, pricing, and service level agreements, and executing binding professional service contracts.

Negotiating contracts with clients or service providers involves defining engagement scope and deliverables, soliciting proposals, comparing provider capabilities and pricing, negotiating service levels, intellectual property terms, and liability provisions, and executing contracts that govern the business relationship. This definition exposes actions for professional service procurement management, event triggers for contract milestones, and searches for provider performance and agreement records.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { negotiateContractsClientsServiceProviders } from '@headlessly/negotiate-contracts-clients-service-providers'

const contracts = negotiateContractsClientsServiceProviders()

// Define requirements for a managed IT services engagement
const requirements = await contracts.defineRequirements({
  serviceType: 'managed-it-infrastructure',
  scope: ['server-management', 'network-monitoring', 'helpdesk-support'],
  duration: '36-months',
  locations: ['headquarters', 'regional-office-east', 'regional-office-west']
})

// Solicit and evaluate provider proposals
const rfp = await contracts.solicitProposals({
  requirementsId: requirements.id,
  providers: ['techops-global', 'managed-systems-inc', 'cloudbridge-services'],
  responseDeadline: '2026-04-30'
})

// Negotiate and execute the contract
await contracts.negotiateServiceLevels({
  proposalId: rfp.preferred.id,
  metrics: [
    { name: 'uptime', target: 99.95, penalty: '5-percent-credit-per-0.01-below' },
    { name: 'response-time', target: '15-minutes-critical', penalty: '2-percent-credit-per-incident' },
    { name: 'resolution-time', target: '4-hours-critical', penalty: '3-percent-credit-per-breach' }
  ]
})

await contracts.executeContract({
  proposalId: rfp.preferred.id,
  contractType: 'master-service-agreement',
  startDate: '2026-07-01',
  autoRenewal: true
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Monitor SLA compliance after contract execution
contracts.contractExecuted(async ({ contractId, serviceLevels }) => {
  await scheduleRecurring({
    action: 'evaluateProviders',
    contractId,
    metrics: serviceLevels.map(s => s.name),
    frequency: 'monthly'
  })
})

// Alert on contract expiration approaching
contracts.requirementsDefined(async ({ contractId, expirationDate }) => {
  await scheduleReminder({
    triggerDate: subtractDays(expirationDate, 120),
    to: 'contract-negotiator',
    message: `Contract ${contractId} expires in 120 days. Begin renewal negotiations.`
  })
})
```
