## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { negotiateAgreementsResolveDisputes } from '@headlessly/negotiate-agreements-resolve-disputes'

const disputes = negotiateAgreementsResolveDisputes()

// Assess a commercial dispute
const assessment = await disputes.assessDispute({
  partyA: 'acme-manufacturing',
  partyB: 'reliable-logistics',
  issue: 'late-delivery-damages',
  claimedAmount: 340000,
  description: 'Repeated shipment delays causing production line shutdowns'
})

// Conduct settlement sessions
await disputes.conductSettlementSession({
  disputeId: assessment.id,
  mediator: 'commercial-mediation-services',
  date: '2026-04-10',
  agenda: ['damage-quantification', 'service-level-remediation', 'future-performance-guarantees']
})

// Propose and execute settlement
await disputes.proposeSettlement({
  disputeId: assessment.id,
  terms: {
    financialCompensation: 180000,
    serviceCredits: 50000,
    performanceGuarantee: 'on-time-delivery-98-percent',
    monitoringPeriod: '12-months'
  }
})

await disputes.executeAgreement({
  disputeId: assessment.id,
  releaseOfClaims: true,
  effectiveDate: '2026-05-01'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Escalate unresolved disputes after multiple sessions
disputes.settlementSessionConducted(async ({ disputeId, outcome, sessionCount }) => {
  if (outcome === 'no-resolution' && sessionCount >= 4) {
    await notify({
      to: 'legal-counsel',
      message: `Dispute ${disputeId} unresolved after ${sessionCount} sessions. Consider formal arbitration.`
    })
  }
})

// Monitor compliance with settlement terms
disputes.agreementExecuted(async ({ disputeId, monitoringPeriod, performanceGuarantee }) => {
  await scheduleRecurring({
    action: 'assessDispute',
    disputeId,
    checkType: 'compliance-review',
    metric: performanceGuarantee,
    frequency: 'monthly',
    duration: monitoringPeriod
  })
})
```
