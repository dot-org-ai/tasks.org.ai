## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { resolveEmployeeContractorProblems } from '@headlessly/resolve-employee-contractor-problems'

const workforce = resolveEmployeeContractorProblems()

// Receive and investigate a performance complaint
const complaint = await workforce.receiveComplaint({
  type: 'performance-deficiency',
  subject: 'contractor-abc-consulting',
  reporter: 'project-manager-smith',
  description: 'Missed three consecutive project deadlines and deliverable quality below standards',
  priority: 'high'
})

await workforce.investigateIssue({
  complaintId: complaint.id,
  interviews: ['project-manager-smith', 'team-lead-jones', 'contractor-abc-consulting'],
  evidenceRequested: ['project-timelines', 'deliverable-reviews', 'communication-logs']
})

// Develop and implement corrective action
await workforce.developCorrectiveAction({
  complaintId: complaint.id,
  actions: [
    { step: 'weekly-progress-reviews', deadline: 'immediate', responsible: 'project-manager-smith' },
    { step: 'deliverable-quality-checklist', deadline: '2026-04-15', responsible: 'contractor-abc-consulting' },
    { step: 'contract-amendment-with-penalties', deadline: '2026-04-30', responsible: 'procurement-team' }
  ],
  reviewDate: '2026-06-01'

```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Escalate high-severity complaints
workforce.severityAssessed(async ({ complaintId, severity, subjectType }) => {
  if (severity === 'critical') {
    await notify({
      to: ['hr-director', 'legal-counsel'],
      message: `Critical ${subjectType} issue ${complaintId} requires immediate attention`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-close resolved cases after monitoring period
workforce.outcomeMonitored(async ({ complaintId, status, monitoringPeriod }) => {
  if (status === 'improved' && monitoringPeriod === 'complete') {
    await workforce.closeCase({ complaintId, resolution: 'corrective-action-successful' })
  }
})
```
