## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { resolvePersonnelProblems } from '@headlessly/resolve-personnel-problems'

const personnel = resolvePersonnelProblems()

// Identify a chronic attendance issue
const issue = await personnel.identifyIssue({
  type: 'chronic-absenteeism',
  employee: 'emp-4521',
  reportedBy: 'supervisor-martinez',
  description: 'Unexcused absences on 8 of last 20 scheduled shifts',
  policyReference: 'attendance-policy-3.2'
})

// Investigate and counsel
await personnel.investigateCircumstances({
  caseId: issue.id,
  reviewRecords: ['attendance-log', 'leave-requests', 'prior-warnings'],
  interviews: ['supervisor-martinez', 'emp-4521']
})

await personnel.conductCounseling({
  caseId: issue.id,
  attendees: ['hr-manager-chen', 'supervisor-martinez', 'emp-4521'],
  topics: ['attendance-expectations', 'available-leave-options', 'eap-resources'],
  outcome: 'verbal-warning-issued'
})

// Develop remediation if needed
await personnel.developRemediation({
  caseId: issue.id,
  steps: [
    { action: 'daily-check-in-with-supervisor', duration: '30-days' },
    { action: 'eap-counseling-referral', sessions: 3 },
    { action: 'attendance-review', date: '2026-05-15' }

// Escalate repeated disciplinary actions
personnel.disciplineApplied(async ({ caseId, employeeId, warningLevel }) => {
  if (warningLevel === 'final-written') {
    await notify({
      to: ['hr-director', 'employment-counsel'],
      message: `Final written warning issued to ${employeeId}. Case ${caseId} may require termination review.`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-schedule follow-up after counseling
personnel.counselingConducted(async ({ caseId, employeeId }) => {
  await scheduleReminder({
    triggerDate: addDays(new Date(), 30),
    to: 'employee-relations-officer',
    message: `30-day follow-up due for personnel case ${caseId} (${employeeId})`
