## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { resolveInterpersonalConflicts } from '@headlessly/resolve-interpersonal-conflicts'

const conflicts = resolveInterpersonalConflicts()

// Open a new conflict case
const conflictCase = await conflicts.openCase({
  complainant: 'emp-401',
  respondent: 'emp-502',
  department: 'engineering',
  description: 'Disagreement over project responsibilities and communication style'
})

// Schedule mediation
await conflicts.scheduleMediationSession({
  caseId: conflictCase.id,
  date: '2026-02-12',
  mediator: 'hr-specialist-03',
  location: 'conference-room-B'
})

// Finalize the agreement
await conflicts.finalizeAgreement({
  caseId: conflictCase.id,
  terms: [
    'Weekly check-in meetings established',
    'Project responsibilities documented in shared charter',
    'Follow-up review in 30 days'
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert HR when a case is escalated
conflicts.caseEscalated(async ({ caseId, severity }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'hr-director',
    message: `Conflict case ${caseId} escalated with severity: ${severity}`
  })
})

// Schedule follow-up after agreement
conflicts.agreementFinalized(async ({ caseId, parties }) => {
  await scheduleFollowUp({
    caseId,
    parties,
    reviewDate: addDays(new Date(), 30)
  })
})
```
