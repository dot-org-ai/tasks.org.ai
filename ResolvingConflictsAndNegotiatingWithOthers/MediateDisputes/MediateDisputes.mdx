## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { mediateDisputes } from '@headlessly/mediate-disputes'

const mediation = mediateDisputes()

// Screen a new case
const screening = await mediation.screenCase({
  parties: ['tenant-corp', 'landlord-llc'],
  disputeType: 'lease-termination',
  referredBy: 'district-court-5'
})

// Open mediation and conduct a joint session
const mCase = await mediation.openMediation({ screeningId: screening.id })

await mediation.conductJointSession({
  caseId: mCase.id,
  agenda: ['opening-statements', 'issue-identification', 'interest-exploration']
})

// Execute the settlement
await mediation.executeAgreement({
  caseId: mCase.id,
  terms: [
    'Lease extended 6 months at reduced rate',
    'Maintenance obligations shared equally',
    'Right of first refusal on renewal'
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify referring court when mediation concludes
mediation.agreementExecuted(async ({ caseId, referringCourt }) => {
  await notify({
    to: referringCourt,
    message: `Mediation case ${caseId} has been resolved with a signed agreement`
  })
})

// Track impasse rates for quality improvement
mediation.impasseDeclared(async ({ caseId, disputeType }) => {
  await logMetric({
    event: 'mediation-impasse',
    caseId,
    disputeType
  })
})
```
