const arbitration = arbitrateDisputesBetweenPartiesResolve()

// File a new arbitration case
const arbCase = await arbitration.fileCase({
  claimant: 'corp-alpha',
  respondent: 'corp-beta',
  claimType: 'breach-of-contract',
  amount: 250000,

})

// Appoint an arbitrator
await arbitration.appointArbitrator({
  caseId: arbCase.id,
  arbitratorId: 'arb-panel-12',
  type: 'single-arbitrator'
})

// Issue the final award
await arbitration.issueAward({
  caseId: arbCase.id,
  inFavorOf: 'claimant',

  await notifyParties({
    caseId,
    message: `Arbitration hearing scheduled for ${date} at ${location}`
  })
})

// Record award for enforcement tracking

    await registerForEnforcement({ caseId, amount })
  }
})
```
