## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { driveVehiclesTransportPatrons } from '@headlessly/drive-vehicles-transport-patrons'

const transport = driveVehiclesTransportPatrons()

// Assign a trip to a driver and vehicle
const trip = await transport.assignTrip({
  patronId: 'patron-2201',
  driverId: 'driver-415',
  vehicleId: 'vehicle-88',
  pickup: { address: '100 Main St', time: '2026-03-15T08:00:00Z' },
  destination: { address: '500 Airport Blvd' }
})

// Begin and pick up the patron
await transport.beginTrip({ tripId: trip.id })
await transport.pickupPatron({ tripId: trip.id, confirmedAt: '2026-03-15T08:05:00Z' })

// Complete the trip after drop-off
await transport.dropOffPatron({ tripId: trip.id })
await transport.completeTrip({ tripId: trip.id, fare: 45.00, distanceMiles: 22.4 })
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify dispatcher when a route deviation occurs
transport.routeDeviated(async ({ tripId, driverId, deviation }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'dispatch-center',
    message: `Driver ${driverId} deviated from route on trip ${tripId}: ${deviation.reason}`
  })
})

// Auto-generate trip summary on completion
transport.tripCompleted(async ({ tripId, patronId, fare, distanceMiles }) => {
  await generateReceipt({ tripId, patronId, fare, distanceMiles })
})
```
