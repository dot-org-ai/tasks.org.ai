# Pilot Water Vessels

> Business-as-Code definition for piloting water vessels including commercial ships, tugboats, ferries, and harbor craft through navigable waterways. Models the complete voyage lifecycle from voyage planning through departure, transit, docking, and post-voyage procedures.

## Overview

Piloting water vessels involves planning transit routes through harbors, rivers, coastal waters, and open ocean; maneuvering vessels through channels, locks, and ports; communicating with vessel traffic services; managing weather and sea conditions; and completing port arrival and departure procedures. This definition covers commercial maritime pilotage, harbor operations, and inland waterway navigation from voyage assignment through post-voyage reporting.

## Actors

| Actor | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| VesselTrafficService | Shore-based authority monitoring and directing vessel movements |
| CoastGuard | Maritime safety and law enforcement authority |
| PortAuthority | Organization managing harbor operations and berth assignments |
| ShipOwner | Entity that owns the vessel and employs the crew |
| CargoAgent | Representative coordinating cargo loading and discharge schedules |
| TugboatOperator | Provider of assist tugs for docking and undocking maneuvers |

## Roles

| Role | Description |

| NavigationOfficer | Officer managing charts, radar, and electronic navigation systems |

## Entities

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| VoyagePlan | Documented route, waypoints, tidal windows, and contingencies |
| PilotageOrder | Request for a licensed pilot to board and guide a vessel |
| NavigationChart | Electronic or paper chart covering the transit area |
| TidalSchedule | Predicted tide heights and current flows for the route |
| BerthAssignment | Designated dock position and arrival window |
| VesselLog | Official record of positions, headings, speeds, and events |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { pilotWaterVessels } from '@headlessly/pilot-water-vessels'

const pilotage = pilotWaterVessels()

// Plan the inbound voyage
const voyage = await pilotage.planVoyage({
  vessel: 'MV-Pacific-Horizon',
  imo: '9876543',
  route: 'Ambrose-Channel-to-Newark-Bay',
  waypoints: ['Ambrose-Light', 'Verrazano-Narrows', 'Kill-Van-Kull', 'Newark-Channel'],
  tidalWindow: { highTide: '2026-05-12T08:42Z', draft: 12.5 },
  destination: 'Port-Newark-Berth-74'
})

// Request pilotage
const order = await pilotage.requestPilotage({
  voyageId: voyage.id,
  port: 'New-York-New-Jersey',
  eta: '2026-05-12T06:00Z',
  vesselType: 'container-ship',
  loa: 294,
  beam: 32.2
})

// Navigate the waterway
await pilotage.navigateWaterway({
  voyageId: voyage.id,
  pilotId: order.assignedPilotId,
  speed: 8,
  channels: ['Ambrose-Channel', 'Kill-Van-Kull'],
  underKeelClearance: 2.1
})

// Coordinate tugs for docking
await pilotage.coordinateTugs({
  voyageId: voyage.id,
  tugs: [
    { name: 'McAllister-Freedom', position: 'bow', power: 5000 },
    { name: 'McAllister-Liberty', position: 'stern', power: 4200 }
  ],
  berth: 'Newark-74'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify port operations when vessel enters the channel
pilotage.vesselBoarded(async ({ vesselId, voyageId, eta }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'port-operations',
    message: `Pilot aboard ${vesselId} - ETA berth: ${eta}`
  })
})

// Alert harbor master on tidal window changes
pilotage.waypointPassed(async ({ voyageId, waypoint, underKeelClearance }) => {
  if (underKeelClearance < 1.5) {
    await notify({
      to: 'harbor-master',
      message: `Low under-keel clearance (${underKeelClearance}m) at ${waypoint} for voyage ${voyageId}`
    })
  }
})
```
