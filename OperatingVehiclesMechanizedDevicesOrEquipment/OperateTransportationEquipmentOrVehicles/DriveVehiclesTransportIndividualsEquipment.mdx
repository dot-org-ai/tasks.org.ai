## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { driveVehiclesTransportIndividualsEquipment } from '@headlessly/drive-vehicles-transport-individuals-equipment'

const transport = driveVehiclesTransportIndividualsEquipment()

// Submit a transport request
const request = await transport.submitTransportRequest({
  type: 'passenger',
  pickup: { address: '100 Main St', time: '2026-04-20T08:00:00Z' },
  dropOff: { address: '500 Corporate Blvd' },
  passengers: 3,
  notes: 'Wheelchair accessible vehicle required'
})

// Dispatch a vehicle
await transport.dispatchVehicle({
  requestId: request.id,
  vehicleId: 'van-accessible-012',
  driverId: 'driver-056'
})

// Complete the trip after drop-off
await transport.completeTrip({
  requestId: request.id,
  mileage: 18.4,
  duration: 32,
  status: 'delivered'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify passenger when vehicle is dispatched
transport.vehicleDispatched(async ({ requestId, vehicleId, estimatedArrival }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'requester',
    message: `Vehicle ${vehicleId} dispatched. Estimated pickup: ${estimatedArrival}`
  })
})

// Alert fleet manager on cancellations
transport.transportCancelled(async ({ requestId, reason }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'fleet-manager',
    message: `Transport request ${requestId} cancelled: ${reason}`
  })
})
```
