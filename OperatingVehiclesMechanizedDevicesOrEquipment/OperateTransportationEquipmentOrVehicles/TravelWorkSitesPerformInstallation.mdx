## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { travelWorkSitesPerformInstallation } from '@headlessly/travel-work-sites-perform-installation'

const fieldService = travelWorkSitesPerformInstallation()

// Assign a work order to a technician
const assignment = await fieldService.assignWorkOrder({
  workOrderId: 'WO-2026-4892',
  technicianId: 'tech-martinez',
  scheduledDate: '2026-03-20',
  timeSlot: '08:00-12:00'
})

// Plan optimal route for the day
const route = await fieldService.planRoute({
  technicianId: 'tech-martinez',
  date: '2026-03-20',
  startLocation: 'depot-north',
  workOrders: ['WO-2026-4892', 'WO-2026-4893', 'WO-2026-4895']
})

// Complete the work order after service
await fieldService.completeWorkOrder({
  workOrderId: 'WO-2026-4892',
  partsUsed: [{ partNumber: 'COMP-4410', quantity: 2 }],
  laborHours: 1.5,
  notes: 'Replaced compressor unit and tested system performance'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify customer when technician is en route
fieldService.technicianDispatched(async ({ workOrderId, technicianId, eta }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'customer',
    message: `Your technician is on the way. Estimated arrival: ${eta}`
  })
})

// Trigger inventory reorder when parts are consumed
fieldService.workOrderClosed(async ({ partsUsed }) => {
  for (const part of partsUsed) {
    const stock = await getStockLevel(part.partNumber)
    if (stock.quantity < stock.reorderPoint) {
      await createPurchaseOrder({ partNumber: part.partNumber, quantity: stock.reorderQuantity })
    }
  }
})
```
