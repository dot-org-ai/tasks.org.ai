## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { ruleAdmissibilityLegalProceedings } from '@headlessly/rule-admissibility-legal-proceedings'

const proceedings = ruleAdmissibilityLegalProceedings()

// Receive a new evidence submission
const submission = await proceedings.receiveSubmission({
  caseId: 'CASE-2026-04521',
  type: 'documentary',
  description: 'Financial records from defendant corporation',
  submittedBy: 'prosecution',
  exhibits: ['EX-101', 'EX-102']
})

// Evaluate admissibility against rules of evidence
const evaluation = await proceedings.evaluateAdmissibility({
  submissionId: submission.id,
  standards: ['relevance', 'hearsay', 'authentication'],
  jurisdiction: 'federal'
})

// Issue a formal ruling
await proceedings.issueRuling({
  submissionId: submission.id,
  decision: 'admitted',
  rationale: 'Documents authenticated and relevant under FRE 401-403',
  conditions: ['Redact personal identifiers per protective order']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify counsel when rulings are issued
proceedings.rulingIssued(async ({ caseId, submissionId, decision }) => {
  await notify({
    to: ['prosecution', 'defense'],
    message: `Ruling on submission ${submissionId}: ${decision}`
  })
})

// Auto-seal excluded evidence
proceedings.evidenceExcluded(async ({ submissionId, caseId }) => {
  await proceedings.sealEvidence({
    submissionId,
    reason: 'Excluded from proceedings per court ruling'
  })
})
```
