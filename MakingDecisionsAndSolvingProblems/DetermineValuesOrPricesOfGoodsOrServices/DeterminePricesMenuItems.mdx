## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { determinePricesMenuItems } from '@headlessly/determine-prices-menu-items'

const menu = determinePricesMenuItems()

// Calculate recipe cost for a menu item
const recipeCost = await menu.calculateRecipeCost({
  itemId: 'MENU-ENTREE-042',
  name: 'Pan-Seared Salmon',
  ingredients: [
    { item: 'atlantic-salmon-fillet', quantity: 0.25, unit: 'kg', unitPrice: 28.00 },
    { item: 'seasonal-vegetables', quantity: 0.15, unit: 'kg', unitPrice: 6.50 },
    { item: 'herb-butter', quantity: 0.03, unit: 'kg', unitPrice: 18.00 }
  ]
})

// Determine the selling price
const price = await menu.determinePrice({
  itemId: 'MENU-ENTREE-042',
  recipeCost: recipeCost.totalCost,
  targetFoodCostPercent: 30,
  category: 'entree'
})

// Publish updated menu prices
await menu.publishMenuPrices({
  effectiveDate: '2026-03-01',
  channels: ['dine-in', 'takeout', 'delivery']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Recalculate prices when ingredient costs change
menu.recipeCostCalculated(async ({ itemId, totalCost, previousCost }) => {
  const changePercent = ((totalCost - previousCost) / previousCost) * 100
  if (Math.abs(changePercent) > 5) {
    await menu.adjustPricing({
      itemId,
      reason: `Ingredient cost changed by ${changePercent.toFixed(1)}%`
    })
  }
})

// Alert management on low-profitability items
menu.profitabilityEvaluated(async ({ itemId, contributionMargin }) => {
  if (contributionMargin < 0.15) {
    await notify({
      to: 'restaurant-manager',
      message: `Low margin on ${itemId}: ${(contributionMargin * 100).toFixed(1)}%`
    })
  }
})
```
