## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { estimateCostsTermsSales } from '@headlessly/estimate-costs-terms-sales'

const estimates = estimateCostsTermsSales()

// Estimate costs for a customer request
const estimate = await estimates.estimateCosts({
  customerId: 'CUST-2026-1184',
  items: [
    { productId: 'SVC-CONSULTING', quantity: 40, unit: 'hours' },
    { productId: 'LIC-ENTERPRISE', quantity: 1, unit: 'annual' }
  ],
  specifications: { region: 'north-america', supportLevel: 'premium' }
})

// Configure payment and delivery terms
await estimates.configureTerms({
  estimateId: estimate.id,
  paymentTerms: { net: 30, method: 'invoice' },
  deliveryTerms: { method: 'electronic', timeline: '5-business-days' },
  warranty: '12-months'
})

// Generate the formal quotation
const quote = await estimates.generateQuotation({
  estimateId: estimate.id,
  validUntil: '2026-04-30',
  currency: 'USD'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Follow up on expiring quotations
estimates.quotationGenerated(async ({ estimateId, validUntil }) => {
  await scheduleReminder({
    daysBeforeExpiry: 7,
    to: 'sales-representative',
    message: `Quotation for ${estimateId} expires on ${validUntil}`
  })
})

// Track conversion metrics
estimates.estimateConverted(async ({ estimateId, customerId, amount }) => {
  await recordMetric({
    type: 'estimate-conversion',
    customerId,
    amount,
    source: estimateId
  })
})
```
