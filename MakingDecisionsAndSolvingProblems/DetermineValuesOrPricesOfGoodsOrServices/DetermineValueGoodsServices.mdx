## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { determineValueGoodsServices } from '@headlessly/determine-value-goods-services'

const valuations = determineValueGoodsServices()

// Initiate a valuation engagement
const engagement = await valuations.initiateValuation({
  assetType: 'commercial-equipment',
  description: 'CNC machining center, Model VMC-850, 2022',
  purpose: 'insurance-coverage',
  requestedBy: 'property-owner'
})

// Calculate value using market approach
const value = await valuations.calculateValue({
  engagementId: engagement.id,
  methodology: 'market-comparison',
  comparables: ['COMP-001', 'COMP-002', 'COMP-003'],
  adjustments: { condition: 'good', utilization: 'moderate', age: 4 }
})

// Certify the final valuation
await valuations.certifyValue({
  engagementId: engagement.id,
  determinedValue: value.assessedValue,
  effectiveDate: '2026-02-01',
  certifiedBy: 'senior-valuer'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify stakeholders when valuations are certified
valuations.valueCertified(async ({ engagementId, determinedValue, assetType }) => {
  await notify({
    to: ['property-owner', 'insurance-company'],
    message: `Valuation complete for ${assetType}: $${determinedValue}`
  })
})

// Flag challenged valuations for senior review
valuations.valuationChallenged(async ({ engagementId, challengedBy, reason }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'valuation-reviewer',
    message: `Valuation ${engagementId} challenged by ${challengedBy}: ${reason}`
  })
})
```
