## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { authorizeFinancialActions } from '@headlessly/authorize-financial-actions'

const finance = authorizeFinancialActions()

// Initiate a financial action
const action = await finance.initiateAction({
  type: 'wire-transfer',
  amount: 1250000,
  currency: 'USD',
  counterparty: 'Global Supply Corp',
  purpose: 'Quarterly supplier payment per contract GSC-2025-014',
  requestedBy: 'treasury-manager'
})

// Assess risk and check compliance
await finance.assessRisk({
  actionId: action.id,
  factors: ['counterparty-risk', 'currency-exposure', 'concentration-limit']
})

await finance.checkCompliance({
  actionId: action.id,
  regulations: ['aml-kyc', 'ofac-screening', 'internal-policy']
})

// Authorize the action
await finance.authorizeAction({
  actionId: action.id,
  approvedBy: 'cfo',
  conditions: ['dual-signature-required']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Enforce dual authorization for high-value transactions
finance.actionAuthorized(async ({ actionId, amount, approvedBy }) => {
  if (amount > 1000000) {
    await notify({
      to: 'board-treasurer',
      message: `Second authorization required for ${actionId}: $${amount}`
    })
  }
})

// Alert on unauthorized access attempts
finance.unauthorizedAttemptDetected(async ({ actionId, requestedBy, reason }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'compliance-officer',
    message: `Unauthorized financial action attempt by ${requestedBy}: ${reason}`
  })
})
```
