### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { authorizePaymentsSettleLegalDisputes } from '@headlessly/authorize-payments-settle-legal-disputes'

const settlements = authorizePaymentsSettleLegalDisputes()

// Assess a proposed settlement
const assessment = await settlements.assessSettlement({
  disputeId: 'DISP-2026-00892',
  proposedAmount: 175000,
  terms: 'Full release with confidentiality provision',
  legalExposure: 450000,

  amount: 175000,
  justification: 'Settlement at 39% of estimated exposure',

```typescript
// Route high-value settlements for executive approval
settlements.authorizationRequested(async ({ disputeId, amount }) => {
  if (amount > 500000) {
    await escalate({
      to: 'ceo',
      message: `Settlement authorization for ${disputeId} requires executive approval: $${amount}`
    })
  }
})

// Generate audit record upon payment
settlements.paymentExecuted(async ({ disputeId, amount, authorizationId }) => {
  await settlements.recordSettlement({
    disputeId,
    amount,
    authorizationChain: authorizationId,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  })
})
```
