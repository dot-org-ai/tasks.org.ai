## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { estimateSuppliesIngredientsStaffRequirements } from '@headlessly/estimate-supplies-ingredients-staff-requirements'

const kitchen = estimateSuppliesIngredientsStaffRequirements()

// Forecast demand for Saturday dinner service
const forecast = await kitchen.forecastDemand({
  date: '2026-03-14',
  mealPeriod: 'dinner',
  expectedCovers: 220
})

// Calculate ingredient needs from menu and forecast
const ingredients = await kitchen.calculateIngredients({
  forecastId: forecast.id,
  menuId: 'spring-dinner-2026'
})

// Estimate staffing for the shift
const staffing = await kitchen.estimateStaffing({
  date: '2026-03-14',
  mealPeriod: 'dinner',
  prepVolume: ingredients.totalPrepItems
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-order when pantry stock falls short
kitchen.stockShortageDetected(async ({ ingredientId, deficit, neededBy }) => {
  await kitchen.placeSupplyOrder({
    ingredientId,
    quantity: deficit,
    deliveryDate: neededBy,
    preferredVendor: 'primary'
  })
})

// Notify kitchen manager when prep sheet is ready
kitchen.prepSheetGenerated(async ({ date, mealPeriod, totalItems }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'kitchen-manager',
    message: `Prep sheet for ${date} ${mealPeriod} is ready: ${totalItems} items`
  })
})
```
