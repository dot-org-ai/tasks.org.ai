## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { selectMaterialsProps } from '@headlessly/select-materials-props'

const props = selectMaterialsProps()

// Define material requirements for a theater production
const requirements = await props.defineRequirements({
  projectId: 'prod-hamlet-2026',
  items: [
    { type: 'fabric', description: 'Velvet draping for throne room', quantity: 30, unit: 'yards' },
    { type: 'prop', description: 'Antique crown replica', quantity: 1 },
    { type: 'furniture', description: 'Wooden banquet table', quantity: 2 }
  ]
})

// Evaluate available sources
const sources = await props.evaluateSources({
  requirementId: requirements.id,
  maxBudget: 8000
})

// Select materials after sample review
await props.selectMaterials({
  requirementId: requirements.id,
  selections: [
    { itemId: 'fabric-01', sourceId: sources[0].id, cost: 450 },
    { itemId: 'crown-01', sourceId: sources[2].id, cost: 1200 }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify art director when selections are ready for review
props.materialsSelected(async ({ projectId, selections }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'art-director',
    message: `${selections.length} materials selected for project ${projectId} - awaiting approval`
  })
})

// Auto-generate purchase orders on approval
props.selectionApproved(async ({ requirementId, selections }) => {
  for (const selection of selections) {
    await props.placeOrder({
      requirementId,
      sourceId: selection.sourceId,
      itemId: selection.itemId,
      quantity: selection.quantity
    })
  }
})
```
