## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { selectEducationalMaterialsEquipment } from '@headlessly/select-educational-materials-equipment'

const selection = selectEducationalMaterialsEquipment()

// Review candidate textbooks for 9th grade biology
const reviews = await selection.reviewMaterials({
  subject: 'Biology',
  gradeLevel: 9,
  adoptionCycleId: 'AC-2026-Science',
  candidates: ['BIO-TEXT-001', 'BIO-TEXT-002', 'BIO-TEXT-003']
})

// Compare and rank the candidates
const ranking = await selection.compareMaterials({
  evaluations: reviews.map(r => r.id),
  rubricId: 'RUBRIC-SCIENCE-HS'
})

// Pilot the top-ranked material
await selection.pilotMaterial({
  materialId: ranking.topCandidate.id,
  classroomIds: ['RM-204', 'RM-318'],
  duration: '6-weeks'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify department chairs when pilot results are in
selection.pilotCompleted(async ({ materialId, results, recommendation }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'department-chairs',
    message: `Pilot for ${materialId} complete: ${recommendation} (score: ${results.overallScore})`
  })
})

// Auto-generate purchase order on adoption approval
selection.materialApproved(async ({ materialId, quantity, vendorId }) => {
  await selection.placePurchaseOrder({
    materialId,
    quantity,
    vendorId,
    deliveryDate: '2026-08-01'
  })
})
```
