### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { editDocuments } from '@headlessly/edit-documents'

const docs = editDocuments()

// Submit a document for editing
const submission = await docs.submitForEditing({
  documentId: 'annual-report-2026',
  author: 'finance-department',
  type: 'annual-report',
  deadline: '2026-03-15'
})

// Review and add comments
await docs.reviewDocument({
  documentId: submission.documentId,
  reviewer: 'senior-editor',
  focusAreas: ['clarity', 'consistency', 'style-compliance']
})

await docs.addEditorialComments({
  documentId: submission.documentId,
  comments: [
    { section: 'executive-summary', text: 'Tighten opening paragraph for conciseness' },
    { section: 'financial-results', text: 'Verify Q4 revenue figure against audited statements' }

docs.editorialCommentsAdded(async ({ documentId, commentCount }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'document-author',
    message: `${commentCount} editorial comments added to document ${documentId} - revisions needed`
  })
})

// Auto-assign proofreader after revisions
docs.documentRevised(async ({ documentId, revisionNumber }) => {
  await docs.proofreadDocument({
    documentId,
    assignee: 'proofreading-pool',
    revisionNumber
  })
