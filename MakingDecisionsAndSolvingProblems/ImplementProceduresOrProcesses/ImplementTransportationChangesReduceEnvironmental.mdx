# Implement Transportation Changes to Reduce Environmental Impact

> Business-as-Code definition for implementing transportation changes that reduce environmental impact. Models the full lifecycle from emissions baselining through fleet transition, route optimization, and sustainability reporting.

## Overview

Implementing transportation changes to reduce environmental impact involves evaluating current logistics and fleet operations, identifying opportunities for emissions reduction, and executing sustainable transportation strategies. This includes transitioning to alternative fuel vehicles, optimizing delivery routes, consolidating shipments, shifting freight modes, and establishing carbon offset programs. The definition exposes actions for planning and executing green transportation initiatives, events for monitoring environmental outcomes, and searches for emissions and compliance data.

## Actors

| Actor | Description |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| emissionsBaselineMeasured | The current transportation carbon footprint has been calculated |
| reductionOpportunitiesIdentified | Potential emissions reduction strategies have been cataloged |
| fleetTransitionPlanned | A vehicle replacement schedule has been established |
| routesOptimized | Delivery routes have been redesigned for lower fuel consumption |
| shipmentsConsolidated | Loads have been combined reducing total transport trips |
| modeShiftEvaluated | Freight mode transition feasibility analysis is complete |
| lowEmissionVehiclesProcured | New low-emission vehicles have been added to the fleet |
| carbonOffsetsApplied | Carbon credits have been purchased and applied to emissions balance |
| emissionsTargetAchieved | Transportation emissions have met the defined reduction target |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getEmissionsData | Retrieve emissions records by vehicle, route, or time period |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { implementTransportationChangesToReduceEnvironmentalImpact } from '@headlessly/implement-transportation-changes-to-reduce-environmental-impact'

const transport = implementTransportationChangesToReduceEnvironmentalImpact()

// Measure current emissions baseline
const baseline = await transport.measureEmissionsBaseline({
  scope: 'all-fleet',
  period: { start: '2025-01-01', end: '2025-12-31' },
  includeIndirect: true
})

// Optimize delivery routes for fuel reduction
await transport.optimizeRoutes({
  region: 'northeast',
  objectives: ['minimize-fuel', 'minimize-distance'],
  constraints: { maxDeliveryTime: '4h', vehicleCapacity: '80%' }
})

// Plan fleet transition to electric vehicles
await transport.planFleetTransition({
  targetFleetPercentage: 0.60,
  vehicleType: 'battery-electric',
  timeline: { start: '2026-Q1', end: '2028-Q4' },
  budget: 4500000
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert when emissions target is achieved
transport.emissionsTargetAchieved(async ({ reductionPercentage, period }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'sustainability-team',
    message: `Transportation emissions reduced by ${reductionPercentage}% for ${period}`
  })
})

// Auto-purchase offsets when quarterly report shows gap
transport.routesOptimized(async ({ region, fuelSavingsPercent }) => {
  if (fuelSavingsPercent < 10) {
    await transport.purchaseCarbonOffsets({
      quantity: calculateOffsetGap(region),
      provider: 'verified-carbon-standard'
    })
  }
})
```
