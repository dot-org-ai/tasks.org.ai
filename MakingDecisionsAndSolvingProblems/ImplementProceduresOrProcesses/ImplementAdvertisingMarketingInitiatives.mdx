## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { implementAdvertisingMarketingInitiatives } from '@headlessly/implement-advertising-marketing-initiatives'

const campaigns = implementAdvertisingMarketingInitiatives()

// Create a new campaign brief
const brief = await campaigns.createCampaignBrief({
  name: 'Q2 Product Launch',
  objective: 'Drive awareness and trial for new product line',
  targetAudience: { segment: 'tech-early-adopters', ageRange: '25-44' },
  budget: 250000,
  channels: ['digital', 'social', 'email'],
  timeline: { start: '2026-04-01', end: '2026-06-30' }
})

// Launch the campaign once assets and media plan are ready
await campaigns.launchCampaign({
  campaignId: brief.id,
  activationDate: '2026-04-01'
})

// Track performance against objectives
const metrics = await campaigns.trackPerformance({
  campaignId: brief.id,
  period: 'week-1'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Optimize underperforming campaigns automatically
campaigns.performanceThresholdReached(async ({ campaignId, metric, value }) => {
  if (metric === 'clickThroughRate' && value < 0.02) {
    await campaigns.optimizeCampaign({
      campaignId,
      adjustments: { action: 'refresh-creative', reallocateBudget: true }
    })
  }
})

// Generate final report when campaign closes
campaigns.campaignClosed(async ({ campaignId }) => {
  const report = await campaigns.trackPerformance({ campaignId, period: 'full' })
  await distribute({ to: 'marketing-leadership', report })
})
```
