## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { implementFinancialDecisions } from '@headlessly/implement-financial-decisions'

const finance = implementFinancialDecisions()

// Verify compliance before executing a capital allocation
const compliance = await finance.verifyCompliance({
  decisionId: 'FD-2026-Q1-014',
  actionType: 'capital-allocation',
  amount: 2500000,
  regulations: ['SOX', 'GAAP']
})

// Execute the approved financial transaction
const transaction = await finance.executeTransaction({
  decisionId: 'FD-2026-Q1-014',
  type: 'wire-transfer',
  fromAccount: 'CORP-OPERATING-001',
  toAccount: 'PROJECT-EXPANSION-042',
  amount: 2500000,
  currency: 'USD'
})

// Record and monitor the outcome
await finance.recordTransaction({
  transactionId: transaction.id,
  ledgerAccount: '1200-Capital-Projects',
  period: '2026-Q1'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Create audit trail entry for every executed transaction
finance.transactionExecuted(async ({ transactionId, decisionId, amount }) => {
  await finance.recordTransaction({
    transactionId,
    decisionId,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  })
})

// Alert compliance team when large transactions are executed
finance.capitalAllocated(async ({ decisionId, amount, department }) => {
  if (amount > 1000000) {
    await notify({
      to: 'compliance-team',
      message: `Capital allocation of $${amount.toLocaleString()} to ${department} requires review (Decision: ${decisionId})`
    })
  }
})
```
