## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { manageDocumentationEnsureOrganizationAccuracy } from '@headlessly/manage-documentation-ensure-organization-accuracy'

const docs = manageDocumentationEnsureOrganizationAccuracy()

// Establish filing standards for a department
await docs.establishFilingStandards({
  department: 'quality-assurance',
  standards: {
    namingConvention: '{department}-{type}-{date}-{version}',
    categories: ['procedures', 'work-instructions', 'forms', 'records'],
    storageLocation: 'document-management-system'
  }
})

// Verify document accuracy
await docs.verifyAccuracy({
  documentId: 'QA-PROC-2026-001-v3',
  reviewer: 'quality-reviewer',
  checkAgainst: ['source-regulation', 'process-data', 'stakeholder-input']
})

// Check for expired documents
const expired = await docs.findExpiredDocuments({
  department: 'quality-assurance',
  retentionExceededBy: 30,
  unit: 'days'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on document discrepancies
docs.discrepancyDetected(async ({ documentId, issue, severity }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'document-controller',
    message: `Discrepancy in ${documentId}: ${issue} (severity: ${severity})`
  })
})

// Auto-schedule reviews for updated documents
docs.versionUpdated(async ({ documentId, version, updatedBy }) => {
  await docs.conductDocumentReview({
    documentId,
    version,
    reviewers: ['quality-reviewer', 'department-head'],
    deadline: '30-days'
  })
})
```
