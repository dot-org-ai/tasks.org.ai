## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { coordinateSafetyRegulatoryComplianceActivities } from '@headlessly/coordinate-safety-regulatory-compliance-activities'

const compliance = coordinateSafetyRegulatoryComplianceActivities()

// Conduct a safety audit
const audit = await compliance.conductSafetyAudit({
  facility: 'manufacturing-plant-east',
  scope: ['fall-protection', 'machine-guarding', 'chemical-storage'],
  auditor: 'safety-manager'
})

// Schedule compliance training
await compliance.scheduleComplianceTraining({
  topic: 'hazard-communication-update',
  employees: ['all-manufacturing'],
  deadline: '2026-05-01',
  format: 'in-person'
})

// Track regulatory changes
const changes = await compliance.getRegulatoryUpdates({
  agencies: ['osha', 'epa'],
  since: '2026-01-01',
  relevantTo: ['manufacturing', 'chemical-handling']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on regulatory changes
compliance.regulatoryChangeDetected(async ({ regulation, agency, effectiveDate }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'compliance-coordinator',
    message: `New regulation from ${agency}: ${regulation}. Effective ${effectiveDate}`
  })
})

// Auto-schedule training when certification expires
compliance.certificationExpiring(async ({ certification, expirationDate, employees }) => {
  await compliance.scheduleComplianceTraining({
    topic: certification,
    employees,
    deadline: expirationDate,
    format: 'online'
  })
})
```
