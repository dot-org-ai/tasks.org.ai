## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { hostEvents } from '@headlessly/host-events'

const hosting = hostEvents()

// Welcome guests and start check-in
await hosting.welcomeGuests({
  eventId: 'evt-2026-summit',
  openingTime: '08:00',
  greeters: ['staff-101', 'staff-102']
})

// Check in an attendee
await hosting.checkInAttendee({
  eventId: 'evt-2026-summit',
  attendeeId: 'att-5521',
  badgeType: 'VIP',
  timestamp: new Date()
})

// Deliver a program session
await hosting.deliverProgram({
  eventId: 'evt-2026-summit',
  sessionId: 'keynote',
  presenter: 'Jane Smith',
  startTime: '09:00',
  duration: 60
})

// Handle an incident
await hosting.manageIncident({
  eventId: 'evt-2026-summit',
  type: 'technical',
  description: 'Microphone not working in Room B',
  severity: 'high',
  assignedTo: 'tech-director'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert staff when VIP guests arrive
hosting.attendeeCheckedIn(async ({ attendeeId, badgeType }) => {
  if (badgeType === 'VIP') {
    await notify({
      to: 'guest-relations-team',
      message: `VIP guest ${attendeeId} has arrived`
    })
  }
})

// Escalate high-severity incidents
hosting.incidentManaged(async ({ severity, type, description }) => {
  if (severity === 'critical') {
    await notify({
      to: 'event-manager',
      priority: 'urgent',
      message: `Critical incident: ${type} - ${description}`
    })
  }
})
```
