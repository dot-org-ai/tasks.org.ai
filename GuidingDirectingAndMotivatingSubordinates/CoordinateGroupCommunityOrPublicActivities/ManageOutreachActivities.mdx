## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { manageOutreachActivities } from '@headlessly/manage-outreach-activities'

const outreach = manageOutreachActivities()

// Create a new community outreach program
const program = await outreach.createProgram({
  name: 'Digital Literacy for Seniors',
  targetCommunity: 'Senior Citizens',
  goals: ['Teach basic computer skills', 'Increase internet confidence'],
  duration: { start: '2026-03-01', end: '2026-06-30' }
})

// Schedule an event within the program
const event = await outreach.scheduleEvent({
  programId: program.id,
  name: 'Introduction to Email',
  date: '2026-03-15',
  location: 'Community Center',
  expectedAttendees: 30
})

// Recruit and assign volunteers
await outreach.recruitVolunteers({
  eventId: event.id,
  roles: ['Tech Instructor', 'Setup Assistant'],

// Notify media partners when an event is scheduled
outreach.eventScheduled(async ({ event }) => {
  await notifyPartners({
    channels: ['local-news', 'social-media'],
    message: `Join us for ${event.name} on ${event.date}`
  })
})

// Generate impact reports automatically after events
outreach.eventExecuted(async ({ eventId }) => {
  const impact = await outreach.measureImpact({ eventId })
  if (impact.completionRate > 0.8) {
    await outreach.publishReport({ eventId })
  }
})
```
