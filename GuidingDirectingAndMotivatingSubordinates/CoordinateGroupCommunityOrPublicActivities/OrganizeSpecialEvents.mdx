// Create an annual fundraiser gala
const gala = await events.createEvent({
  name: 'Annual Charity Gala 2026',
  type: 'fundraiser',
  date: '2026-09-15',
  expectedAttendees: 350,
  theme: 'Starlight Soiree'

events.vendorContracted(async ({ eventId }) => {
  const contracts = await events.getVendorContracts({ eventId })
  const allConfirmed = contracts.every(c => c.status === 'signed')
  if (allConfirmed) {
    await notify({
      to: 'event-planner',
      message: `All vendor contracts confirmed for event ${eventId}`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-generate post-event report
events.eventExecuted(async ({ eventId, attendeeCount }) => {
