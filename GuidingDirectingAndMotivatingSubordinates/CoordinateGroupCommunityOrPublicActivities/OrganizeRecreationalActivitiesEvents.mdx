### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { organizeRecreationalActivitiesEvents } from '@headlessly/organize-recreational-activities-events'

const recreation = organizeRecreationalActivitiesEvents()

// Define a new summer swim program
const activity = await recreation.createActivity({
  name: 'Adult Lap Swim',
  type: 'aquatics',
  ageGroup: '18+',
  season: 'summer',
  maxCapacity: 30
})

// Schedule weekly sessions

  venue: 'Riverside Community Pool',
  startDate: '2026-06-01',
  recurrence: 'weekly',
  time: '06:00-07:30'

    message: `${activityName} is now full. Consider adding another session.`
  })
})

// Send post-event survey
recreation.eventCompleted(async ({ eventId, participants }) => {
  for (const participant of participants) {
    await sendSurvey({
      to: participant.email,
      template: 'recreation-feedback',
      eventId
    })
  }
})
