### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { coordinateSpecialEventsPrograms } from '@headlessly/coordinate-special-events-programs'

const events = coordinateSpecialEventsPrograms()

// Plan a new conference
const event = await events.planEvent({
  name: 'Annual Tech Summit 2026',
  date: '2026-09-15',
  type: 'conference',
  expectedAttendees: 500
})

// Book venue and contract vendors
await events.bookVenue({

  capacity: 600,
  date: '2026-09-15'
})

await events.contractVendor({
  eventId: event.id,
  vendorName: 'Premier Catering',
  service: 'food-beverage',

    message: `Registration is now live for event ${eventId}`
  })
})

// Alert logistics team when program is scheduled
events.programScheduled(async ({ eventId, sessions }) => {
  await events.coordinateLogistics({
    eventId,
    items: sessions.map(s => ({
      type: 'av-equipment',
      session: s.name,
      requirements: s.techNeeds
