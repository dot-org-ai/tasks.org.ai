## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { manageAgriculturalForestryOperations } from '@headlessly/manage-agricultural-forestry-operations'

const operations = manageAgriculturalForestryOperations()

// Plan corn production for spring season
const plan = await operations.planProduction({
  season: 'spring-2026',
  cropType: 'corn',
  acreage: 500,
  targetYield: 180,
  fields: ['north-40', 'east-60', 'south-100']
})

// Allocate resources
await operations.allocateResources({
  planId: plan.id,
  equipment: ['tractor-1', 'planter-2', 'combine-3'],
  labor: { workers: 12, supervisor: 'foreman-jones' },
  inputs: { seed: 5000, fertilizer: 10000, pesticide: 500 }
})

// Schedule planting
await operations.schedulePlanting({
  planId: plan.id,
  startDate: '2026-04-15',
  endDate: '2026-05-10',
  weatherWindow: 'dry-conditions-required'
})

// Monitor growth and schedule harvest
await operations.monitorGrowth({
  planId: plan.id,
  metrics: ['soilMoisture', 'plantHeight', 'pestPressure'],
  frequency: 'weekly'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert when weather threatens planting schedule
operations.plantingScheduled(async ({ planId, startDate }) => {
  const forecast = await getWeatherForecast({ startDate, days: 7 })
  if (forecast.rainfall > 2) {
    await notify({
      to: 'operations-manager',
      priority: 'high',
      message: `Heavy rain forecast may delay planting for ${planId}`
    })
  }
})

// Trigger harvest when crop maturity detected
operations.growthMonitored(async ({ planId, metrics }) => {
  if (metrics.maturity >= 95) {
    await operations.scheduleHarvest({
      planId,
      window: 'next-2-weeks',
      priority: 'high'
    })
  }
})
```
