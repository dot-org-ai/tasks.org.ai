## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { assignClassWorkStudents } from '@headlessly/assign-class-work-students'

const classwork = assignClassWorkStudents()

// Create an assignment
const assignment = await classwork.createAssignment({
  course: 'AP-Biology-Period-3',
  title: 'Cellular Respiration Lab Report',
  type: 'lab-report',
  instructions: 'Write a formal lab report analyzing the results of the cellular respiration experiment.',
  rubric: ['hypothesis', 'methodology', 'data-analysis', 'conclusion'],
  points: 100
})

// Differentiate for accommodation students
await classwork.differentiateAssignment({
  assignmentId: assignment.id,
  modifications: [
    { studentGroup: 'extended-time', deadlineExtension: 3, unit: 'days' },
    { studentGroup: 'simplified-format', instructions: 'Complete the guided lab report template.' }
  ]
})

// Check submission status
const status = await classwork.getSubmissionStatus({
  assignmentId: assignment.id,
  course: 'AP-Biology-Period-3'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify parents of late submissions
classwork.lateSubmissionDetected(async ({ studentId, assignmentTitle, dueDate }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'parent-guardian',
    message: `${studentId} has not submitted "${assignmentTitle}" due ${dueDate}`
  })
})

// Auto-balance workload across courses
classwork.assignmentCreated(async ({ course, dueDate }) => {
  const workload = await classwork.getWorkloadSummary({ date: dueDate })
  if (workload.averageAssignmentsDue > 3) {
    await notify({
      to: 'instructor',
      message: `Students have ${workload.averageAssignmentsDue} assignments due on ${dueDate}. Consider adjusting the deadline.`
    })
  }
})
```
