## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { prepareStaffSchedulesWorkAssignments } from '@headlessly/prepare-staff-schedules-work-assignments'

const scheduling = prepareStaffSchedulesWorkAssignments()

// Draft a weekly schedule
const draft = await scheduling.draftSchedule({
  team: 'retail-floor',
  week: '2026-04-13',
  shifts: ['morning', 'afternoon', 'evening'],
  minimumStaff: { morning: 4, afternoon: 5, evening: 3 }
})

// Match skills to specialized tasks
await scheduling.matchSkillsToTasks({
  scheduleId: draft.id,
  tasks: [
    { name: 'cash-register', requiredSkill: 'pos-certified' },
    { name: 'inventory-receiving', requiredSkill: 'forklift-licensed' }
  ]
})

// Distribute the finalized schedule
await scheduling.distributeSchedule({
  scheduleId: draft.id,
  channels: ['email', 'mobile-app'],
  advanceNoticeDays: 7
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on scheduling conflicts
scheduling.schedulingConflictDetected(async ({ shift, date, issue }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'scheduling-manager',
    message: `Scheduling conflict on ${date} ${shift}: ${issue}`
  })
})

// Auto-notify staff on schedule publication
scheduling.scheduleDistributed(async ({ scheduleId, team, affectedEmployees }) => {
  for (const employee of affectedEmployees) {
    await notify({
      to: employee.id,
      message: `Your schedule for ${team} has been published. Check your assignments.`
    })
  }
})
```
