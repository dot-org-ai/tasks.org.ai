## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { assignDutiesWorkSchedulesEmployees } from '@headlessly/assign-duties-work-schedules-employees'

const duties = assignDutiesWorkSchedulesEmployees()

// Assign a specific duty
await duties.assignDuty({
  employee: 'officer-badge-4412',
  duty: 'patrol-district-7',
  shift: 'evening',
  date: '2026-04-10',
  specialInstructions: 'Focus on school zone enforcement'
})

// Place employees on schedule
await duties.placeOnSchedule({
  team: 'patrol-division',
  week: '2026-04-13',
  placements: [
    { employee: 'officer-badge-4412', shifts: ['mon-evening', 'tue-evening', 'wed-off'] },
    { employee: 'officer-badge-4415', shifts: ['mon-day', 'tue-day', 'wed-evening'] }
  ]
})

// Check workload equity
const equity = await duties.getWorkloadEquity({
  team: 'patrol-division',
  period: '2026-04',
  metrics: ['night-shifts', 'weekend-duties', 'overtime-hours']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on workload imbalance
duties.workloadImbalanceDetected(async ({ team, employee, metric, deviation }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'equity-monitor',
    message: `Workload imbalance in ${team}: ${employee} has ${deviation}% more ${metric} than average`
  })
})

// Follow up on unacknowledged assignments
duties.dutyAssigned(async ({ employee, duty, assignedAt }) => {
  setTimeout(async () => {
    const pending = await duties.findPendingAcknowledgments({ employee })
    if (pending.length > 0) {
      await notify({
        to: employee,
        message: `Please acknowledge your duty assignment: ${duty}`
      })
    }
  }, 4 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // 4 hours
})
```
