## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { prepareEmployeeWorkSchedules } from '@headlessly/prepare-employee-work-schedules'

const schedules = prepareEmployeeWorkSchedules()

// Draft shift assignments for the week
await schedules.draftShiftAssignments({
  team: 'nursing-unit-3B',
  week: '2026-04-13',
  employees: [
    { id: 'nurse-201', shifts: ['mon-day', 'tue-day', 'wed-day', 'thu-off', 'fri-evening'] },
    { id: 'nurse-202', shifts: ['mon-evening', 'tue-evening', 'wed-off', 'thu-day', 'fri-day'] }
  ]
})

// Configure rotation pattern
await schedules.configureRotation({
  team: 'nursing-unit-3B',
  pattern: ['day', 'day', 'evening', 'evening', 'off', 'off', 'night'],
  cycleLength: 7,
  startDate: '2026-04-01'
})

// Check overtime risks
const risks = await schedules.findOvertimeRisks({
  team: 'nursing-unit-3B',
  week: '2026-04-13',
  threshold: 40
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on overtime projection
schedules.overtimeProjected(async ({ employeeId, projectedHours, limit }) => {
  if (projectedHours > limit) {
    await notify({
      to: 'shift-coordinator',
      message: `Employee ${employeeId} projected at ${projectedHours}h, exceeds ${limit}h limit`
    })
  }
})

// Notify employee on schedule publication
schedules.individualSchedulePublished(async ({ employeeId, week, shifts }) => {
  await notify({
    to: employeeId,
    message: `Your schedule for week of ${week} is ready: ${shifts.length} shifts assigned`
  })
})
```
