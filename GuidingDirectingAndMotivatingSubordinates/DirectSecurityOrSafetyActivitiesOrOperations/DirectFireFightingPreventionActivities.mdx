## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { directFireFightingPreventionActivities } from '@headlessly/direct-fire-fighting-prevention-activities'

const fire = directFireFightingPreventionActivities()

// Dispatch units to a structure fire
await fire.dispatchFireUnit({
  incident: 'structure-fire-elm-street',
  location: '1234 Elm Street',
  type: 'structure-fire',
  alarmLevel: 2,
  units: ['engine-7', 'engine-12', 'ladder-3', 'battalion-chief-2']
})

// Conduct a fire inspection
const inspection = await fire.conductFireInspection({
  building: 'riverside-mall',
  inspector: 'fire-prevention-officer',
  areas: ['sprinkler-system', 'fire-exits', 'alarm-system', 'extinguishers']
})

// Check apparatus readiness
const readiness = await fire.getApparatusReadiness({
  station: 'station-7',
  equipment: ['engine', 'ladder', 'ambulance']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-request mutual aid on high-alarm fires
fire.fireUnitDispatched(async ({ incident, alarmLevel }) => {
  if (alarmLevel >= 3) {
    await fire.requestMutualAid({
      incident,
      resourcesNeeded: ['engine-company', 'ladder-company'],
      departments: ['neighboring-city-fd', 'county-fd']
    })
  }
})

// Auto-schedule follow-up inspection after violations
fire.fireInspectionCompleted(async ({ building, violations }) => {
  if (violations.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'fire-prevention-officer',
      message: `${violations.length} violations at ${building}. Follow-up inspection required within 30 days.`
    })
  }
})
```
