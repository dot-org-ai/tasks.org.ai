## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { directEmergencyManagementActivities } from '@headlessly/direct-emergency-management-activities'

const emergency = directEmergencyManagementActivities()

// Activate response for a flooding event
await emergency.activateResponse({
  incident: 'river-valley-flood-2026',
  type: 'natural-disaster',
  severity: 'major',
  affectedArea: 'river-valley-district',
  estimatedPopulation: 45000
})

// Deploy resources to the incident
await emergency.deployResources({
  incident: 'river-valley-flood-2026',
  resources: [
    { type: 'swift-water-rescue-team', quantity: 3 },
    { type: 'shelter-supply-kit', quantity: 500 },
    { type: 'portable-generator', quantity: 20 }
  ]
})

// Check active incidents
const active = await emergency.getActiveIncidents({
  jurisdiction: 'county',
  severity: 'major'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-notify agencies on response activation
emergency.responseActivated(async ({ incident, severity, affectedArea }) => {
  await notify({
    to: ['federal-emergency-agency', 'red-cross', 'national-guard'],
    message: `Emergency activated: ${incident} (${severity}) in ${affectedArea}`
  })
})

// Auto-generate after-action report on recovery
emergency.recoveryInitiated(async ({ incident, duration, resourcesUsed }) => {
  await emergency.conductAfterAction({
    incident,
    responseDuration: duration,
    resourcesDeployed: resourcesUsed,
    reviewDeadline: '30-days'
  })
})
```
