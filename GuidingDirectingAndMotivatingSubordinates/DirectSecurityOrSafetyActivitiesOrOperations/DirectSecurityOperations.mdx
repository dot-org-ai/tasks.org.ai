## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { directSecurityOperations } from '@headlessly/direct-security-operations'

const security = directSecurityOperations()

// Deploy personnel for a shift
await security.deploySecurityPersonnel({
  shift: 'night-2026-04-15',
  assignments: [
    { officer: 'officer-martinez', post: 'main-lobby', hours: '22:00-06:00' },
    { officer: 'officer-patel', post: 'parking-garage', hours: '22:00-06:00' },
    { officer: 'officer-kim', post: 'roving-patrol', hours: '22:00-06:00' }
  ]
})

// Respond to an alarm event
await security.respondToAlarm({
  alarmId: 'alarm-2026-04-15-0342',
  location: 'server-room-B',
  type: 'door-forced-open',
  respondingOfficer: 'officer-kim'
})

// Check patrol completion
const patrols = await security.getPatrolStatus({
  shift: 'night-2026-04-15',
  status: 'incomplete'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-notify law enforcement on critical alarms
security.alarmTriggered(async ({ location, type, severity }) => {
  if (severity === 'critical') {
    await notify({
      to: 'law-enforcement-dispatch',
      message: `Critical alarm: ${type} at ${location}. Immediate response requested.`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-generate daily security summary
security.patrolCompleted(async ({ shift, completedRoutes, totalRoutes }) => {
  if (completedRoutes === totalRoutes) {
    await security.fileIncidentReport({
      type: 'shift-summary',
      shift,
      status: 'all-patrols-complete',
      notes: 'No incidents during patrol cycle'
    })
  }
})
```
