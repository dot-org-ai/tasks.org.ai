## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { coordinateEnforcementLawsRegulations } from '@headlessly/coordinate-enforcement-laws-regulations'

const enforcement = coordinateEnforcementLawsRegulations()

// Schedule inspections for a district
await enforcement.scheduleInspection({
  district: 'industrial-zone-north',
  regulation: 'clean-air-act',
  inspectors: ['inspector-adams', 'inspector-chen'],
  period: '2026-Q2'
})

// Issue a citation
await enforcement.issueCitation({
  entity: 'acme-manufacturing',
  violation: 'exceeding-emissions-limits',
  regulation: 'clean-air-act-section-112',
  correctiveAction: 'Install scrubber system',
  deadline: '2026-07-01'
})

// Track remediation progress
const progress = await enforcement.getRemediationProgress({
  entity: 'acme-manufacturing',
  status: 'in-progress'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-escalate missed remediation deadlines
enforcement.remediationDeadlinePassed(async ({ entity, violation, deadline }) => {
  await enforcement.escalateEnforcement({
    entity,
    violation,
    reason: `Remediation deadline ${deadline} missed`,
    action: 'refer-to-legal'
  })
})

// Auto-schedule follow-up inspections
enforcement.citationIssued(async ({ entity, deadline }) => {
  await enforcement.scheduleInspection({
    entity,
    type: 'follow-up',
    scheduledDate: deadline,
    reason: 'citation-compliance-verification'
  })
})
```
