## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { directCriminalInvestigations } from '@headlessly/direct-criminal-investigations'

const investigations = directCriminalInvestigations()

// Assign an investigator to a new case
await investigations.assignInvestigator({
  caseId: 'case-2026-04821',
  offense: 'commercial-burglary',
  leadDetective: 'detective-ruiz',
  supportTeam: ['evidence-tech-johnson', 'analyst-chen'],
  priority: 'high'
})

// Collect evidence from a crime scene
await investigations.collectEvidence({
  caseId: 'case-2026-04821',
  scene: '4500-industrial-boulevard',
  items: [
    { type: 'fingerprint-lift', location: 'rear-door-handle' },
    { type: 'surveillance-footage', location: 'neighboring-business' },
    { type: 'tool-mark-impression', location: 'window-frame' }
  ],
  technician: 'evidence-tech-johnson'

// Review active investigations
const active = await investigations.getActiveCases({
  priority: 'high',
  status: 'open',
  assignedTo: 'detective-ruiz'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-notify prosecutor when case is ready
investigations.caseReferredForProsecution(async ({ caseId, offense, suspect }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'district-attorney-intake',
    message: `Case ${caseId} (${offense}) ready for prosecution review. Suspect: ${suspect}`
  })
})

// Auto-escalate stalled investigations
investigations.caseProgressReviewed(async ({ caseId, daysSinceLastAction, priority }) => {
  if (daysSinceLastAction > 30 && priority === 'high') {
    await notify({
      to: 'investigation-commander',
      message: `High-priority case ${caseId} has had no activity for ${daysSinceLastAction} days. Review recommended.`
    })
  }
})
```
