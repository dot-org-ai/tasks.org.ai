## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { directLawEnforcementActivities } from '@headlessly/direct-law-enforcement-activities'

const enforcement = directLawEnforcementActivities()

// Deploy patrol units for evening shift
await enforcement.deployPatrolUnits({
  shift: 'evening-2026-04-15',
  assignments: [
    { officer: 'officer-thompson', beat: 'downtown-1', vehicle: 'unit-214' },
    { officer: 'officer-garcia', beat: 'residential-3', vehicle: 'unit-307' },
    { officer: 'officer-lee', beat: 'commercial-2', vehicle: 'unit-118' }
  ]
})

// Conduct a special operation
await enforcement.conductSpecialOperation({
  name: 'operation-safe-corridor',
  type: 'narcotics-enforcement',
  location: 'highway-corridor-south',
  personnel: ['sergeant-davis', 'detective-unit-3', 'k9-unit'],
  duration: { start: '2026-04-16T20:00', end: '2026-04-17T04:00' }
})

// Review crime statistics for a district
const stats = await enforcement.getCrimeStatistics({
  beat: 'downtown-1',
  period: '2026-Q1',
  categories: ['property-crime', 'violent-crime']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-notify oversight board on use-of-force incidents
enforcement.useOfForceReviewed(async ({ officer, incidentId, forceLevel }) => {
  if (forceLevel === 'lethal' || forceLevel === 'serious') {
    await notify({
      to: 'civilian-oversight-board',
      message: `Use of force incident ${incidentId} by ${officer} (level: ${forceLevel}) requires board review.`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-generate weekly activity reports
enforcement.activityReportGenerated(async ({ shift, callsResponded, citations, arrests }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'watch-commander',
    message: `Shift ${shift}: ${callsResponded} calls, ${citations} citations, ${arrests} arrests.`
  })
})
```
