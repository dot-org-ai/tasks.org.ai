## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { coordinateLogisticsProductionsEvents } from '@headlessly/coordinate-logistics-productions-events'

const events = coordinateLogisticsProductionsEvents()

// Create an event logistics plan
const plan = await events.createEventPlan({
  name: 'Annual Tech Conference 2026',
  date: '2026-09-15',
  expectedAttendance: 2000,
  venue: 'Convention Center Hall A'
})

// Book the venue
await events.bookVenue({
  eventId: plan.id,
  venue: 'Convention Center Hall A',
  dates: ['2026-09-14', '2026-09-15', '2026-09-16'],
  setupDay: '2026-09-14'
})

// Build the run of show
await events.buildRunOfShow({
  eventId: plan.id,
  segments: [
    { time: '09:00', activity: 'Registration Opens' },
    { time: '10:00', activity: 'Keynote Address' },
    { time: '12:00', activity: 'Lunch Break' },
    { time: '13:30', activity: 'Breakout Sessions' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-schedule load-in when venue is booked
events.venueBooked(async ({ eventId, setupDay }) => {
  await events.scheduleLoadIn({ eventId, date: setupDay })
})

// Generate post-event report after site operations conclude
events.siteOpsCompleted(async ({ eventId }) => {
  await events.generatePostEventReport({ eventId })
})
```
