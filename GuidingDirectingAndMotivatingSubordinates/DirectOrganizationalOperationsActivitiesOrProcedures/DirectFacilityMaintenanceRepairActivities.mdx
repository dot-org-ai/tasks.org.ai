# Direct Facility Maintenance Repair Activities

> Business-as-Code definition for directing facility maintenance or repair activities. Models the oversight of building systems, structural upkeep, and infrastructure repairs across commercial, industrial, and institutional facilities.

## Overview

Directing facility maintenance and repair activities involves managing building systems, structural upkeep, and occupant services across commercial, industrial, and institutional properties. This definition provides actions for HVAC system optimization, elevator safety compliance, plumbing emergency response, electrical infrastructure management, fire safety inspections, and space utilization planning. It enables automation of tenant request routing, building code compliance tracking, energy consumption monitoring, and occupancy-driven maintenance scheduling.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { directFacilityMaintenanceRepairActivities } from '@headlessly/direct-facility-maintenance-repair-activities'

const facility = directFacilityMaintenanceRepairActivities()

// Route tenant request to appropriate trade
const request = await facility.routeTenantRequest({
  building: 'corporate-tower-a',
  floor: 12,
  tenant: 'acme-corp',
  issue: 'conference-room-temperature-too-warm',
  priority: 'standard'
})

// Optimize HVAC for seasonal change
await facility.optimizeHVAC({
  building: 'corporate-tower-a',
  season: 'cooling',
  setpoints: { cooling: 72, heating: 68, deadband: 2 },
  schedule: 'occupied-6am-6pm'
})

// Schedule elevator inspection
await facility.scheduleLiftInspection({
  building: 'corporate-tower-a',
  elevators: ['elevator-01', 'elevator-02', 'elevator-03'],
  inspectionType: 'annual-safety-test',
  regulatoryDeadline: '2026-06-30'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-dispatch plumbing emergencies
facility.tenantRequestRouted(async ({ requestId, issue, building, floor }) => {
  if (issue.includes('water-leak') || issue.includes('sewer-backup')) {
    await facility.respondToPlumbingEmergency({
      requestId,
      building,
      floor,
      dispatchTime: 'immediate'
    })
  }
})

// Alert on inspection deadline approaching
facility.liftInspectionScheduled(async ({ building, elevators, regulatoryDeadline }) => {
  const daysUntilDeadline = Math.ceil((new Date(regulatoryDeadline) - new Date()) / 86400000)
  if (daysUntilDeadline <= 30) {
    await notify({
      to: 'code-compliance-specialist',
      message: `${building} elevator inspection due in ${daysUntilDeadline} days`
    })
  }
})
```
