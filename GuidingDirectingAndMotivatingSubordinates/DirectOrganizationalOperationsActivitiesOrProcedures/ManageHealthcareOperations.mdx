## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { manageHealthcareOperations } from '@headlessly/manage-healthcare-operations'

const ops = manageHealthcareOperations()

// Forecast patient volume for next month
const forecast = await ops.forecastPatientVolume({
  facility: 'Memorial Hospital',
  period: '2026-04',
  departments: ['emergency', 'surgical', 'medical']
})

// Optimize staffing based on forecast
await ops.optimizeStaffing({
  facility: 'Memorial Hospital',
  period: '2026-04',
  forecast: forecast.id,
  constraints: ['union-rules', 'licensure-requirements']
})

// Review operational metrics
const metrics = await ops.reviewOperationalMetrics({
  facility: 'Memorial Hospital',
  period: '2026-Q1',
  benchmarks: ['cms-star-rating', 'internal-targets']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on bed capacity constraints
ops.bedCapacityUpdated(async ({ facility, occupancyRate }) => {
  if (occupancyRate > 0.9) {
    await notify({
      to: 'patient-access-director',
      message: `${facility} at ${Math.round(occupancyRate * 100)}% bed capacity`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-submit regulatory reports on schedule
ops.operationalMetricsReviewed(async ({ facility, period }) => {
  await ops.submitRegulatoryReport({ facility, period, type: 'quarterly-quality' })
})
```
