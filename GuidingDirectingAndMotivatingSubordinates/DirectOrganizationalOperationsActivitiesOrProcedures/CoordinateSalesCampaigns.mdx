## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { coordinateSalesCampaigns } from '@headlessly/coordinate-sales-campaigns'

const campaigns = coordinateSalesCampaigns()

// Design a new sales campaign
const campaign = await campaigns.designCampaign({
  name: 'Q3 Enterprise Push',
  product: 'Platform Pro',
  audience: 'enterprise-accounts',
  budget: 200000,
  startDate: '2026-07-01',

  assignments: [
    { rep: 'rep-east', territory: 'US-East' },
    { rep: 'rep-west', territory: 'US-West' },
    { rep: 'rep-central', territory: 'US-Central' }

campaigns.engagementTracked(async ({ campaignId, conversionRate }) => {
  if (conversionRate < 0.02) {
    await campaigns.adjustStrategy({
      campaignId,
      changes: { increaseFrequency: true, addChannel: 'direct-mail' }
    })
  }
})

// Auto-generate ROI report on campaign close
campaigns.campaignClosed(async ({ campaignId }) => {
  await campaigns.measureROI({ campaignId })
})
```
