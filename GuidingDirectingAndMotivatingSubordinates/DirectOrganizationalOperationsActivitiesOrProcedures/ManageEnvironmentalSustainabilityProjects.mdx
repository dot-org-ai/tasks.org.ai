## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { manageEnvironmentalSustainabilityProjects } from '@headlessly/manage-environmental-sustainability-projects'

const sustainability = manageEnvironmentalSustainabilityProjects()

// Define a carbon reduction target
await sustainability.defineTarget({
  type: 'carbon-reduction',
  baseline: 50000,
  target: 35000,
  unit: 'metric-tons-co2e',
  deadline: '2028-12-31'
})

// Launch a new green initiative
const project = await sustainability.launchProject({
  name: 'Solar Panel Installation Phase 2',
  facility: 'Manufacturing Plant B',
  expectedReduction: 8000,
  budget: 2000000
})

// Measure current footprint
const footprint = await sustainability.measureFootprint({
  scope: ['scope-1', 'scope-2'],
  period: '2026-Q1'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-generate report when target is achieved
sustainability.targetAchieved(async ({ targetId, actualValue }) => {
  await sustainability.generateImpactReport({ targetId })
  await notify({ to: 'executive-team', message: `Sustainability target met: ${actualValue}` })
})

// Schedule recertification when certification is expiring
sustainability.certificationSubmitted(async ({ certificationId, expirationDate }) => {
  await scheduleReminder({
    date: subtractMonths(expirationDate, 3),
    action: () => sustainability.submitCertification({ certificationId, type: 'renewal' })
  })
})
```
