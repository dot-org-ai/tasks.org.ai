## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { directDepartmentActivities } from '@headlessly/direct-department-activities'

const department = directDepartmentActivities()

// Set quarterly goals
await department.setDepartmentGoals({
  department: 'customer-success',
  period: '2026-Q2',
  goals: [
    { name: 'Reduce churn rate', target: 3.5, unit: 'percent' },
    { name: 'Improve NPS score', target: 72, unit: 'points' },
    { name: 'Complete onboarding automation', target: 100, unit: 'percent' }
  ]
})

// Monitor performance
const metrics = await department.getPerformanceMetrics({
  department: 'customer-success',
  period: '2026-Q2',
  metrics: ['churn-rate', 'nps-score', 'time-to-value']
})

// Generate operational report
await department.generateOperationalReport({
  department: 'customer-success',
  period: '2026-04',
  sections: ['goal-progress', 'staffing', 'budget']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert when performance falls below target
department.performanceReviewed(async ({ department, metric, actual, target }) => {
  if (actual < target * 0.85) {
    await notify({
      to: 'department-director',
      message: `${department} ${metric}: ${actual} is below 85% of target (${target})`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-report budget variances
department.budgetVarianceIdentified(async ({ department, variance, threshold }) => {
  if (Math.abs(variance) > threshold) {
    await department.escalateIssue({
      department,
      type: 'budget-variance',
      details: `Spending ${variance > 0 ? 'over' : 'under'} by ${Math.abs(variance)}%`
    })
  }
})
```
