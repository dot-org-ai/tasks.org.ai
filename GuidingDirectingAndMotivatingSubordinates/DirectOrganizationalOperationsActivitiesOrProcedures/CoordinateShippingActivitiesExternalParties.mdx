```typescript
import { coordinateShippingActivitiesExternalParties } from '@headlessly/coordinate-shipping-activities-external-parties'

const shipping = coordinateShippingActivitiesExternalParties()

// Book a freight carrier
const booking = await shipping.bookCarrier({
  carrier: 'GlobalFreight',
  origin: 'Los Angeles',
  destination: 'Hamburg',
  mode: 'ocean',
  pickupDate: '2026-04-01'
})

  await shipping.fileCustomsDeclaration({ bookingId, destination })
})

// Notify customer on delivery confirmation
shipping.deliveryConfirmed(async ({ bookingId, receivedBy, timestamp }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'receiving-customer',
    message: `Shipment ${bookingId} delivered at ${timestamp}`
  })
})
```
