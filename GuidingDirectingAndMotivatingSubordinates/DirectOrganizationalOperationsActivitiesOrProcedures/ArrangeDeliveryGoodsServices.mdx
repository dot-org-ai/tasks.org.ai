## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { arrangeDeliveryGoodsServices } from '@headlessly/arrange-delivery-goods-services'

const delivery = arrangeDeliveryGoodsServices()

// Schedule a delivery
const scheduled = await delivery.scheduleDelivery({
  orderId: 'order-2026-8841',
  destination: '742 Evergreen Terrace, Springfield',
  preferredWindow: '2026-04-10T09:00/12:00',
  items: [{ sku: 'WH-4420', quantity: 2, weight: 45 }]
})

// Select optimal carrier
const carrier = await delivery.selectCarrier({
  orderId: scheduled.orderId,
  criteria: ['cost', 'speed'],
  destination: scheduled.destination
})

// Track in-transit shipment
const status = await delivery.getShipmentStatus({
  trackingId: 'TRK-2026-8841',
  carrier: carrier.name
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify customer on dispatch
delivery.deliveryDispatched(async ({ orderId, estimatedArrival, trackingId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'customer',
    message: `Order ${orderId} shipped. Estimated arrival: ${estimatedArrival}. Track: ${trackingId}`
  })
})

// Auto-reschedule on exception
delivery.deliveryExceptionRaised(async ({ orderId, reason }) => {
  if (reason === 'customer-not-available') {
    await delivery.scheduleDelivery({
      orderId,
      preferredWindow: 'next-available',
      reattempt: true
    })
  }
})
```
