# Direct Maintenance or Repair Activities

> Business-as-Code definition for directing general maintenance and repair activities. Models the oversight of building systems, infrastructure, and general asset maintenance from work order creation through completion tracking.

This definition provides actions for triaging incoming work requests, managing contractor relationships, tracking service level agreements, and optimizing resource allocation across diverse maintenance portfolios. It enables automation of work order routing, vendor performance monitoring, and department-level budget tracking.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { directMaintenanceRepairActivities } from '@headlessly/direct-maintenance-repair-activities'

const operations = directMaintenanceRepairActivities()

// Triage cross-departmental request
const request = await operations.triageRequest({
  description: 'IT server room cooling failure affecting multiple departments',
  submittedBy: 'department-head-it',
  affectedDepartments: ['IT', 'Finance', 'Operations'],
  priority: 'critical'
})

// Negotiate SLA with contractor
await operations.negotiateSLA({
  vendor: 'multi-trade-services-inc',
  services: ['HVAC', 'electrical', 'plumbing'],
  responseTime: '4-hour-emergency',
  regularResponseTime: '24-hour-standard',
  penaltyTerms: { percentPerHour: 2, maxPenalty: 10 }
})

// Coordinate departments for scheduled work
await operations.coordinateDepartments({
  maintenanceWindow: { start: '2026-03-15T22:00', end: '2026-03-16T06:00' },
  affectedDepartments: ['IT', 'Security', 'Facilities'],
  coordination: 'power-shutdown-required'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-escalate SLA violations
operations.performanceTracked(async ({ vendorId, slaCompliance, requestId }) => {
  if (slaCompliance < 0.9) {
    await operations.escalateIssue({
      requestId,
      reason: 'sla-violation',
      escalateTo: 'contract-administrator'
    })
  }
})

// Alert on budget threshold
operations.budgetSpendApproved(async ({ department, currentSpend, budgetLimit }) => {
  const percentUsed = (currentSpend / budgetLimit) * 100
  if (percentUsed > 80) {
    await notify({
      to: `department-head-${department}`,
      message: `Maintenance budget ${percentUsed}% depleted for ${department}`
    })
  }
})
```
