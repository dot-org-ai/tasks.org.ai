## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { coordinateLogisticsBusinessOperations } from '@headlessly/coordinate-logistics-business-operations'

const logistics = coordinateLogisticsBusinessOperations()

// Plan a new shipment
const shipment = await logistics.planShipment({
  origin: 'Warehouse-Chicago',
  destination: 'Distribution-Center-NYC',
  items: [{ sku: 'PROD-100', quantity: 500 }],
  requiredBy: '2026-04-10'
})

// Optimize the route
const route = await logistics.optimizeRoute({
  shipmentId: shipment.id,
  criteria: 'cost-and-time'
})

// Track the delivery in real-time
const status = await logistics.trackDelivery({
  shipmentId: shipment.id
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on delivery delays
logistics.deliveryDelayed(async ({ shipmentId, expectedDate, estimatedDate }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'supply-chain-manager',
    message: `Shipment ${shipmentId} delayed: expected ${expectedDate}, now ${estimatedDate}`
  })
})

// Auto-reconcile freight on delivery
logistics.deliveryCompleted(async ({ shipmentId, carrierId }) => {
  await logistics.reconcileFreight({ shipmentId, carrierId })
})
```
