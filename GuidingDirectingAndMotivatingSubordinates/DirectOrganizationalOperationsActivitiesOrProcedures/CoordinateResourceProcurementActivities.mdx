## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { coordinateResourceProcurementActivities } from '@headlessly/coordinate-resource-procurement-activities'

const procurement = coordinateResourceProcurementActivities()

// Submit a requisition
const requisition = await procurement.submitRequisition({
  department: 'engineering',
  category: 'cloud-infrastructure',
  description: 'Annual cloud hosting renewal',
  estimatedValue: 240000,
  requiredBy: '2026-06-01'
})

// Issue an RFP
await procurement.issueRFP({
  requisitionId: requisition.id,
  vendors: ['aws', 'azure', 'gcp'],
  responseDeadline: '2026-04-30',
  evaluationCriteria: ['price', 'sla-uptime', 'support-response-time']
})

// Check spend analysis
const spend = await procurement.getSpendAnalysis({
  category: 'cloud-infrastructure',
  period: '2026-Q1',
  groupBy: 'vendor'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-route requisitions for approval
procurement.requisitionSubmitted(async ({ requisitionId, estimatedValue }) => {
  const approver = estimatedValue > 50000 ? 'vp-finance' : 'department-manager'
  await notify({
    to: approver,
    message: `Purchase requisition ${requisitionId} requires approval ($${estimatedValue})`
  })
})

// Alert on spend threshold
procurement.spendThresholdExceeded(async ({ category, spent, budget }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'procurement-coordinator',
    message: `${category} spend ($${spent}) exceeds budget ($${budget})`
  })
})
```
