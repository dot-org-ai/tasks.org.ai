## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { manageClericalAdministrativeActivities } from '@headlessly/manage-clerical-administrative-activities'

const admin = manageClericalAdministrativeActivities()

// Assign a document processing task
await admin.assignAdminTask({
  type: 'document-processing',
  description: 'Process Q1 vendor contracts for filing',
  assignee: 'admin-coordinator-01',
  deadline: '2026-04-15',
  priority: 'medium'
})

// Process an incoming document
await admin.processDocument({
  document: 'vendor-contract-2026-Q1',
  workflow: ['review', 'approve', 'file'],
  department: 'procurement'
})

// Check workload distribution
const workload = await admin.getWorkloadDistribution({
  team: 'admin-pool',
  period: '2026-04'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-rebalance when tasks pile up
admin.adminTaskAssigned(async ({ assignee, pendingCount }) => {
  if (pendingCount > 15) {
    await admin.balanceWorkload({ team: 'admin-pool' })
  }
})

// Auto-dispose expired documents
admin.retentionEnforced(async ({ expiredDocuments }) => {
  for (const doc of expiredDocuments) {
    await notify({
      to: 'records-manager',
      message: `Document ${doc.id} past retention period, ready for disposal`
    })
  }
})
```
