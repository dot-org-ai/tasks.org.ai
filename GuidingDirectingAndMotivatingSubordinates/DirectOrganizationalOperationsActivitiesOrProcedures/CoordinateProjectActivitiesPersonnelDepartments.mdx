## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { coordinateProjectActivitiesPersonnelDepartments } from '@headlessly/coordinate-project-activities-personnel-departments'

const project = coordinateProjectActivitiesPersonnelDepartments()

// Align deliverables across departments
await project.alignDeliverables({
  projectId: 'proj-erp-migration',
  departments: ['engineering', 'finance', 'operations'],
  milestones: [
    { name: 'Data Migration Complete', date: '2026-06-01', owner: 'engineering' },
    { name: 'UAT Sign-off', date: '2026-07-15', owner: 'operations' }
  ]
})

// Track cross-team dependencies
const blocked = await project.findBlockedTasks({
  projectId: 'proj-erp-migration',
  status: 'waiting-on-dependency'
})

// Publish status report
await project.publishStatusReport({
  projectId: 'proj-erp-migration',
  period: '2026-04-W2',
  recipients: ['executive-sponsor', 'department-leads']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-notify when dependency is completed
project.dependencyCompleted(async ({ taskId, dependentTasks, completedBy }) => {
  for (const task of dependentTasks) {
    await notify({
      to: task.owner,
      message: `Dependency resolved: ${taskId} completed by ${completedBy}. Your task ${task.id} is now unblocked.`
    })
  }
})

// Alert on blocker escalation
project.blockerEscalated(async ({ projectId, blocker, impact }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'executive-sponsor',
    message: `Project ${projectId} blocker: ${blocker.description}. Impact: ${impact.delayDays} day delay`
  })
})
```
