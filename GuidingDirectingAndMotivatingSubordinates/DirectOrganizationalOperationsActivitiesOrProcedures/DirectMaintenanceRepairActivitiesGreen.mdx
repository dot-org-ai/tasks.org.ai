# Direct Maintenance Repair Activities Green

> Business-as-Code definition for directing maintenance and repair activities in green energy production facilities. Models the oversight of preventive and corrective maintenance for wind, solar, geothermal, and other renewable energy assets.

## Overview

Directing maintenance and repair activities in green energy production facilities involves managing renewable energy asset performance through IoT-enabled predictive maintenance, environmental compliance, and energy output optimization. This definition provides actions for sensor-driven health monitoring, renewable technology troubleshooting, environmental permit adherence, and power generation maximization. It enables automation of predictive failure alerts, regulatory reporting, grid interconnection coordination, and renewable energy certificate tracking.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { directMaintenanceRepairActivitiesGreen } from '@headlessly/direct-maintenance-repair-activities-green'

const renewable = directMaintenanceRepairActivitiesGreen()

// Analyze turbine telemetry for predictive maintenance
const alerts = await renewable.analyzeTelemetry({
  facility: 'North Ridge Wind Farm',
  assets: ['turbine-NR-001', 'turbine-NR-002'],
  sensors: ['gearbox-vibration', 'generator-temperature', 'blade-strain'],
  analysisWindow: '72-hours'
})

// Schedule predictive maintenance based on failure risk
await renewable.schedulePredictiveMaintenance({
  assetId: 'turbine-NR-017',
  component: 'gearbox-bearing',
  failureProbability: 0.78,
  recommendedWindow: { start: '2026-04-10', end: '2026-04-12' },
  estimatedDowntime: '6-hours'
})

// Optimize solar array output
await renewable.optimizeEnergyOutput({
  facility: 'Desert Sun Solar Farm',
  optimization: 'panel-tracking-adjustment',
  currentIrradiance: 850,
  forecast: { hours: 4, expectedIrradiance: 920 }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-schedule maintenance on high failure risk
renewable.telemetryAnalyzed(async ({ assetId, failureRisk, component }) => {
  if (failureRisk > 0.7) {
    const forecast = await renewable.getMaintenanceWindows({ assetId, days: 14 })
    await renewable.schedulePredictiveMaintenance({
      assetId,
      component,
      failureProbability: failureRisk,
      recommendedWindow: forecast.optimalWindows[0]
    })
  }
})

// Alert on environmental compliance threshold
renewable.environmentalComplianceMonitored(async ({ permit, metric, value, limit }) => {
  const percentOfLimit = (value / limit) * 100
  if (percentOfLimit > 90) {
    await notify({
      to: 'environmental-compliance-officer',
      message: `${permit} ${metric} at ${percentOfLimit}% of permitted limit`
    })
  }
})
```
