## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { directHealthcareDeliveryPrograms } from '@headlessly/direct-healthcare-delivery-programs'

const healthcare = directHealthcareDeliveryPrograms()

// Design a new chronic care management program
const program = await healthcare.designProgram({
  name: 'Diabetes Management Initiative',
  type: 'chronic-care',
  facility: 'Community Health Center',
  targetPopulation: 'type-2-diabetes-patients'
})

// Enroll a patient
await healthcare.enrollPatient({
  programId: program.id,
  patientId: 'patient-5521',
  referralSource: 'primary-care-physician'
})

// Monitor quality metrics
const quality = await healthcare.monitorQuality({
  programId: program.id,
  metrics: ['hba1c-control-rate', 'appointment-adherence', 'readmission-rate']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-assign care coordinator on enrollment
healthcare.patientEnrolled(async ({ programId, patientId }) => {
  await healthcare.assignClinicalStaff({
    programId,
    role: 'care-coordinator',
    patientId
  })
})

// Alert on quality metric deviation
healthcare.qualityMetricTracked(async ({ programId, metric, value, threshold }) => {
  if (value < threshold) {
    await notify({
      to: 'quality-officer',
      message: `${metric} below threshold: ${value} vs ${threshold}`
    })
  }
})
```
