## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { managePreparationSpecialMealsDiets } from '@headlessly/manage-preparation-special-meals-diets'

const dietary = managePreparationSpecialMealsDiets()

// Process a new diet order
await dietary.processDietOrder({
  patientId: 'patient-3302',
  dietType: 'renal-low-sodium',
  restrictions: ['sodium-under-1500mg', 'potassium-limited', 'phosphorus-limited'],
  prescribedBy: 'dietitian-rwilson',
  effectiveDate: '2026-04-08'
})

// Develop a modified menu
await dietary.developModifiedMenu({
  dietType: 'renal-low-sodium',
  mealPeriod: 'lunch',
  date: '2026-04-08',
  items: [
    { name: 'Herb-Grilled Chicken Breast', calories: 320 },
    { name: 'Steamed Green Beans', calories: 45 },
    { name: 'White Rice', calories: 200 }
  ]
})

// Check allergen risks
const risks = await dietary.findAllergenRisks({
  menuDate: '2026-04-08',
  allergens: ['gluten', 'dairy', 'tree-nuts']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on allergen exposure risk
dietary.allergenAlertTriggered(async ({ patientId, allergen, menuItem }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'allergen-coordinator',
    message: `Allergen risk for patient ${patientId}: ${allergen} in ${menuItem}`,
    priority: 'urgent'
  })
})

// Auto-verify meal delivery
dietary.mealDeliveryVerified(async ({ patientId, mealPeriod, dietType, deliveredCorrectly }) => {
  if (!deliveredCorrectly) {
    await notify({
      to: 'dietary-manager',
      message: `Incorrect meal delivered to patient ${patientId} for ${mealPeriod} (expected ${dietType})`
    })
  }
})
```
