## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { coordinateActivitiesFoodServiceStaff } from '@headlessly/coordinate-activities-food-service-staff'

const foodService = coordinateActivitiesFoodServiceStaff()

// Create next week's shift schedule
const schedule = await foodService.createShiftSchedule({
  week: '2026-03-16',
  servicePeriods: ['breakfast', 'lunch', 'dinner'],
  minimumStaff: { breakfast: 4, lunch: 8, dinner: 10 }
})

// Assign stations for dinner service
await foodService.assignStations({
  date: '2026-03-16',
  period: 'dinner',
  assignments: [
    { employee: 'chef-martinez', station: 'grill' },
    { employee: 'chef-lee', station: 'sautee' },
    { employee: 'server-jones', station: 'section-A' }
  ]
})

// Forecast labor for the weekend
const forecast = await foodService.forecastLabor({
  dates: ['2026-03-21', '2026-03-22'],
  basedOn: 'reservations-and-historical'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-call in extra staff when forecast exceeds capacity
foodService.laborForecasted(async ({ date, requiredStaff, scheduledStaff }) => {
  if (requiredStaff > scheduledStaff) {
    const available = await foodService.findAvailableStaff({ date })
    await notify({
      to: available.map(s => s.id),
      message: `Extra shift available on ${date}`
    })
  }
})

// Track performance after each service
foodService.serviceStarted(async ({ date, period }) => {
  // Schedule post-service review
  await scheduleTask({
    after: period,
    action: () => foodService.reviewStaffPerformance({ date, period })
  })
})
```
