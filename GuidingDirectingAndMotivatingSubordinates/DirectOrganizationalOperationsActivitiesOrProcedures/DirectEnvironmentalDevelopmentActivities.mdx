## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { directEnvironmentalDevelopmentActivities } from '@headlessly/direct-environmental-development-activities'

const envDev = directEnvironmentalDevelopmentActivities()

// Start an environmental impact assessment
const assessment = await envDev.initiateAssessment({
  site: 'Riverside Corridor',
  type: 'wetland-restoration',
  scope: 'full'
})

// Deploy field survey team
await envDev.assignFieldTeam({
  projectId: assessment.projectId,
  team: ['ecologist-01', 'hydrologist-02'],
  startDate: '2026-04-15'
})

// Monitor ecological recovery
const metrics = await envDev.monitorEcologicalOutcome({
  projectId: assessment.projectId,
  indicators: ['species-diversity', 'water-quality']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on permit expiration
envDev.permitExpiring(async ({ permitId, expirationDate, projectId }) => {
  await envDev.renewPermit({ permitId })
  await notify({ to: 'compliance-team', message: `Permit ${permitId} expiring ${expirationDate}` })
})

// Auto-report when ecological targets are met
envDev.ecologicalTargetMet(async ({ projectId, indicator, value }) => {
  await envDev.submitComplianceReport({
    projectId,
    type: 'milestone',
    findings: `${indicator} target achieved: ${value}`
  })
})
```
