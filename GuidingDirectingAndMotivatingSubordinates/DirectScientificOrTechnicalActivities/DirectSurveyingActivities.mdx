# Direct Surveying Activities

> Business-as-Code definition for directing surveying activities. Models the oversight of land surveyors, survey technicians, and field crews performing boundary surveys, topographic mapping, construction staking, and geodetic control work.

## Overview

Directing surveying activities involves planning and overseeing field surveys, coordinate computations, boundary determinations, topographic mapping, and construction layout performed by licensed surveyors, survey technicians, and field crews. This definition covers survey project planning, crew assignment, field data collection oversight, quality review of measurements, plat preparation, and compliance with state surveying laws and professional standards.

|--------|-------------|
| planSurveyProject | Define scope, methodology, and crew assignments for a survey |
| assignFieldCrew | Allocate surveying personnel and equipment to field work |
| reviewFieldData | Evaluate raw observations for accuracy and completeness |
| computeCoordinates | Process field measurements into final coordinate values |
| preparePlat | Draft and certify a boundary plat or topographic map |
| certifySurvey | Apply professional seal and signature to survey documents |
| calibrateInstrument | Verify and document accuracy of survey instruments |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| surveyProjectPlanned | A survey project scope and methodology have been defined |
| fieldCrewAssigned | Personnel and instruments have been allocated to fieldwork |
| fieldDataCollected | Raw field observations have been gathered and submitted |
| fieldDataReviewed | Collected measurements have been checked for accuracy |
| coordinatesComputed | Final coordinate values have been calculated |
| platPrepared | A boundary plat or map has been drafted for review |
| surveyCertified | Survey documents have been sealed by a licensed surveyor |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| findActiveSurveys | List survey projects by status, client, or geographic area |
| getControlPoints | Retrieve established control points by project or location |
| findPendingReviews | Identify field data sets awaiting quality review |
| getInstrumentCalibrationStatus | Check calibration currency for survey instruments |

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { directSurveyingActivities } from '@headlessly/direct-surveying-activities'

const surveying = directSurveyingActivities()

// Plan a survey project
const project = await surveying.planSurveyProject({
  client: 'Greenfield Development LLC',
  type: 'boundary-and-topographic',
  parcelId: 'APN-1234-567-890',
  methodology: 'GNSS-RTK-with-total-station',
  deliverables: ['boundary-plat', 'topographic-map', 'digital-terrain-model']
})

// Assign field crew
await surveying.assignFieldCrew({
  projectId: project.id,
  crewChief: 'FC-011',
  technicians: ['ST-022', 'ST-029'],
  instruments: ['GNSS-RX-04', 'TS-ROBO-07'],
  fieldDate: '2026-03-20'
})

// Review field data
const review = await surveying.reviewFieldData({
  projectId: project.id,
  dataSet: 'FD-2026-0320',
  checks: ['closure-ratio', 'redundant-observations', 'control-ties']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify project surveyor when field data is ready for review
surveying.fieldDataCollected(async ({ projectId, crewChief, observationCount }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'project-surveyor',
    message: `Field data for project ${projectId} submitted: ${observationCount} observations by ${crewChief}`
  })
})

// Alert when instrument calibration is due
surveying.getInstrumentCalibrationStatus(async ({ instrumentId, daysUntilDue }) => {
  if (daysUntilDue <= 7) {
    await notify({
      to: 'survey-director',
      message: `Instrument ${instrumentId} calibration due in ${daysUntilDue} days`
    })
    await surveying.calibrateInstrument({ instrumentId })
  }
})
```
