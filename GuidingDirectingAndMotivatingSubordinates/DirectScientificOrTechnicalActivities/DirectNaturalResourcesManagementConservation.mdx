# Direct Natural Resources Management Conservation

> Business-as-Code definition for directing natural resources management or conservation programs. Models the strategic planning, field operations, regulatory compliance, and stakeholder engagement involved in managing and protecting natural resources.

## Overview

Directing natural resources management or conservation programs involves overseeing the protection, sustainable use, and restoration of forests, waterways, wildlife habitats, minerals, and other natural assets. This includes developing conservation plans, managing field teams, coordinating with regulatory agencies, conducting environmental assessments, and engaging communities in stewardship activities. The definition supports resource managers, conservation directors, and environmental program leaders in government agencies, nonprofits, and private land management organizations.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { directNaturalResourcesManagementConservation } from '@headlessly/direct-natural-resources-management-conservation'

const conservation = directNaturalResourcesManagementConservation()

// Establish a watershed restoration program
const program = await conservation.establishProgram({
  name: 'Upper Salmon River Watershed Restoration',
  resourceType: 'watershed',
  region: 'Central Idaho',
  objectives: ['restore-riparian-habitat', 'reduce-sediment-loading', 'improve-salmon-passage'],
  fundingSource: 'NOAA Restoration Center',
  duration: '5 years'
})

// Conduct a baseline environmental assessment
const assessment = await conservation.conductAssessment({
  programId: program.id,
  type: 'baseline-ecological',
  indicators: ['water-quality', 'fish-population', 'riparian-vegetation', 'stream-morphology'],
  area: 'Upper Salmon River - RM 180 to RM 220'
})

// Deploy field teams for restoration work
await conservation.deployFieldTeams({
  programId: program.id,
  teams: [
    { name: 'Riparian Crew', task: 'plant-native-vegetation', location: 'Redfish Creek' },
    { name: 'Fish Passage Team', task: 'remove-barrier-structures', location: 'Stanley Basin' }
  ],
  startDate: '2026-05-15'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on significant resource changes
conservation.resourceAlertTriggered(async ({ programId, indicator, change }) => {
  await notify({
    to: ['conservation-director', 'environmental-scientist'],
    message: `Resource alert: ${indicator} changed by ${change.percentage}% in program ${programId}`
  })
})

// Auto-report compliance violations to regulators
conservation.complianceViolationFound(async ({ programId, violation, area }) => {
  await conservation.reportOutcomes({
    programId,
    type: 'compliance-incident',
    details: violation,
    reportTo: ['environmental-regulator', 'funding-agency']
  })
})
```
