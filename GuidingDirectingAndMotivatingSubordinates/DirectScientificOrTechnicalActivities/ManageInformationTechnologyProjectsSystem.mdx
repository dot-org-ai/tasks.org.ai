## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { manageInformationTechnologyProjectsSystem } from '@headlessly/manage-information-technology-projects-system'

const itProjects = manageInformationTechnologyProjectsSystem()

// Initiate a new IT project
const project = await itProjects.initiateProject({
  name: 'CRM Platform Migration',
  sponsor: 'VP-Sales',
  budget: 850000,
  startDate: '2026-04-01',
  targetDate: '2026-09-30',
  team: ['PM-012', 'ARCH-003', 'DEV-041', 'DEV-042', 'SA-008']
})

// Plan a sprint
await itProjects.planSprint({
  projectId: project.id,
  sprintNumber: 1,
  startDate: '2026-04-01',
  endDate: '2026-04-14',
  stories: [
    { id: 'US-001', title: 'User authentication module', points: 8 },
    { id: 'US-002', title: 'Contact import pipeline', points: 5 },
    { id: 'US-003', title: 'Dashboard wireframes', points: 3 }
  ]
})

// Coordinate a release
await itProjects.coordinateRelease({
  projectId: project.id,
  version: '1.0.0-beta',
  environment: 'staging',
  deploymentWindow: '2026-05-15T02:00:00Z',
  rollbackPlan: 'revert-to-previous-container-image'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert stakeholders when risks escalate
itProjects.riskEscalated(async ({ projectId, riskDescription, severity }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'project-steering-committee',
    message: `Risk escalated on project ${projectId}: ${riskDescription} (severity: ${severity})`
  })
})

// Auto-generate status report after sprint completion
itProjects.sprintCompleted(async ({ projectId, sprintNumber, velocity, completedStories }) => {
  await itProjects.reportProjectStatus({
    projectId,
    reportType: 'sprint-summary',
    data: { sprintNumber, velocity, storiesCompleted: completedStories.length }
  })
})
```
