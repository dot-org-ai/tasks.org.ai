# Direct Technical Activities Operations

> Business-as-Code definition for directing technical activities and operations. Models the leadership of technical teams performing installation, configuration, testing, and operational support across complex systems and infrastructure.

## Overview

Directing technical activities and operations involves leading teams of technicians, specialists, and operators who install, configure, test, maintain, and operate complex technical systems. This definition covers technical project planning, resource allocation, procedure management, operational readiness verification, and performance monitoring to ensure technical operations meet safety, reliability, and efficiency requirements across industrial, communications, and infrastructure environments.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { directTechnicalActivitiesOperations } from '@headlessly/direct-technical-activities-operations'

const techOps = directTechnicalActivitiesOperations()

// Plan a technical project
const project = await techOps.planTechnicalProject({
  name: 'Substation Control System Upgrade',
  scope: 'Replace legacy SCADA controllers with modern IEC 61850 equipment',
  startDate: '2026-04-01',
  endDate: '2026-06-30',
  teamSize: 8
})

// Allocate resources
await techOps.allocateResources({
  projectId: project.id,
  personnel: [
    { technicianId: 'ST-041', specialization: 'controls-engineering' },
    { technicianId: 'ST-055', specialization: 'network-infrastructure' }
  ],
  equipment: ['fiber-optic-toolkit', 'protocol-analyzer']
})

// Verify system readiness
const readiness = await techOps.verifyReadiness({
  systemId: 'SYS-SCADA-012',
  checklist: ['network-connectivity', 'signal-mapping', 'failover-test', 'cybersecurity-scan']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Respond to operational anomalies
techOps.operationsAnomalyDetected(async ({ systemId, anomalyType, severity }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'operations-lead',
    message: `Anomaly detected on ${systemId}: ${anomalyType} (severity: ${severity})`
  })
  if (severity === 'critical') {
    await techOps.conductTechnicalReview({
      systemId,
      scope: 'root-cause-analysis',
      priority: 'immediate'
    })
  }
})

// Track project milestones
techOps.readinessVerified(async ({ systemId, projectId }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'technical-director',
    message: `System ${systemId} has passed readiness verification for project ${projectId}`
  })
})
```
