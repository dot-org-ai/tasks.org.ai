### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { coordinateTrainingActivities } from '@headlessly/coordinate-training-activities'

const training = coordinateTrainingActivities()

// Plan a new leadership development program
const program = await training.planProgram({
  name: 'Manager Essentials',
  objectives: ['Effective delegation', 'Performance feedback', 'Conflict resolution'],
  targetAudience: 'New managers',
  duration: '3 months'
})

// Schedule training sessions
const session = await training.scheduleSession({

  topic: 'Giving Effective Feedback',
  date: '2026-04-15',
  time: '09:00-12:00',
  location: 'Conference Room A',
  maxParticipants: 20
})

// Enroll participants
await training.enrollParticipants({
  sessionId: session.id,
  participants: ['emp-001', 'emp-045', 'emp-087', 'emp-102']
})

// Assign instructor
await training.assignInstructor({

  await notify({
    to: participants,
    subject: `Training Scheduled: ${session.topic}`,
    message: `You are enrolled in training on ${session.date}`
  })
})

// Auto-generate certificates when outcomes meet threshold
training.outcomesAssessed(async ({ enrollmentId, score }) => {
  if (score >= 80) {
    await generateCertificate({
      enrollmentId,
      template: 'completion-certificate'
    })
  }
})
```
