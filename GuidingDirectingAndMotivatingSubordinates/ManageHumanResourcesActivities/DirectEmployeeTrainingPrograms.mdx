## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { directEmployeeTrainingPrograms } from '@headlessly/direct-employee-training-programs'

const trainingLeadership = directEmployeeTrainingPrograms()

// Define organizational training strategy
const strategy = await trainingLeadership.defineStrategy({
  period: '2026-2028',
  priorities: ['Technical Skills', 'Leadership Development', 'Digital Transformation'],
  targetParticipation: 95,
  budgetGrowth: 15
})

// Allocate annual training budget
await trainingLeadership.allocateBudget({
  strategyId: strategy.id,
  year: 2026,
  allocations: {
    technicalTraining: 500000,
    leadershipDevelopment: 300000,
    complianceTraining: 150000,
    vendorPlatforms: 250000
  }
})

// Select and contract training vendor
await trainingLeadership.selectVendors({
  category: 'Technical Skills',
  criteria: ['Content Quality', 'Platform Usability', 'ROI'],
  finalists: ['Vendor A', 'Vendor B'],
  selected: 'Vendor A',
  contractValue: 200000
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert when training completion falls below target
trainingLeadership.progressMonitored(async ({ program, completionRate }) => {
  if (completionRate < 70) {
    await notify({
      to: 'training-director',
      priority: 'high',
      message: `${program} completion at ${completionRate}%, below target`
    })
  }
})

// Automatically trigger program refinement after evaluation
trainingLeadership.effectivenessEvaluated(async ({ programId, impact }) => {
  if (impact.performanceImprovement < 10) {
    await trainingLeadership.refinePrograms({
      programId,
      reason: 'Low performance impact'
    })
  }
})
```
