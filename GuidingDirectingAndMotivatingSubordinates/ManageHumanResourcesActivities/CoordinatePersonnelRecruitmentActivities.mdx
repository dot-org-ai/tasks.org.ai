```typescript
import { coordinatePersonnelRecruitmentActivities } from '@headlessly/coordinate-personnel-recruitment-activities'

const recruitment = coordinatePersonnelRecruitmentActivities()

// Create a job requisition
const req = await recruitment.createRequisition({
  title: 'Senior Software Engineer',
  department: 'Engineering',
  headcount: 2,
  justification: 'Team expansion for new product line',
  salaryRange: { min: 120000, max: 160000 }

  platforms: ['LinkedIn', 'Indeed', 'CompanyWebsite'],
  description: 'We are seeking an experienced engineer...',
  requirements: ['5+ years experience', 'React expertise', 'Team leadership']
})

// Schedule interviews for a candidate
await recruitment.scheduleInterviews({

  interviews: [
    { type: 'Phone Screen', interviewer: 'recruiter@company.com', duration: 30 },

recruitment.postingPublished(async ({ requisitionId, platforms }) => {
  await recruitment.sourceCandidates({
    requisitionId,
    sources: ['RecruitingAgency', 'UniversityCareerCenter']
  })
})

// Notify hiring manager when candidate reaches final stage
recruitment.applicationsTracked(async ({ candidateId, stage }) => {
  if (stage === 'Final Interview') {
    await notify({
      to: 'hiring-manager',
      message: `Candidate ${candidateId} ready for final interview`
