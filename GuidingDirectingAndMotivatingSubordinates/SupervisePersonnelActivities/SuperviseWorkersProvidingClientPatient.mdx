## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { superviseWorkersProvidingClientPatient } from '@headlessly/supervise-workers-providing-client-patient'

const services = superviseWorkersProvidingClientPatient()

// Assign caseload to care worker
await services.assignCaseload({
  workerId: 'cw-308',
  clients: ['client-1201', 'client-1202', 'client-1203'],
  specialization: 'behavioral-health',
  maxCapacity: 25
})

// Conduct supervision session
await services.conductSupervision({
  workerId: 'cw-308',
  type: 'individual-case-review',
  clientsDiscussed: ['client-1201', 'client-1203'],
  findings: 'Client 1203 showing improvement; recommend step-down in frequency',
  nextSessionDate: '2026-02-19'
})

// Audit documentation compliance
const audit = await services.auditDocumentation({
  workerId: 'cw-308',
  period: 'January-2026',
  criteria: ['timeliness', 'completeness', 'clinical-accuracy']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on client safety concern
services.safetyConcernRaised(async ({ clientId, workerId, severity, description }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'clinical-supervisor',
    priority: 'critical',
    message: `Safety concern for client ${clientId}: ${description}`
  })
})

// Auto-rebalance when caseload threshold exceeded
services.caseloadImbalanceDetected(async ({ workerId, currentCount, threshold }) => {
  await services.balanceCaseloads({
    teamId: 'behavioral-health-team',
    reason: `Worker ${workerId} at ${currentCount}/${threshold} capacity`
  })
})
```
