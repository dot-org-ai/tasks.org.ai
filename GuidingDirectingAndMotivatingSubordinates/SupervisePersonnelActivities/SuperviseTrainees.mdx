## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { superviseTrainees } from '@headlessly/supervise-trainees'

const training = superviseTrainees()

// Enroll a new trainee
const trainee = await training.enrollTrainee({
  name: 'Jordan Mitchell',
  program: 'Electrical Apprenticeship - Level 1',
  startDate: '2026-02-10',
  expectedDuration: { months: 12 }
})

// Assign a mentor
await training.assignMentor({
  traineeId: trainee.id,
  mentorId: 'emp-4410',
  focus: ['conduit-installation', 'circuit-testing', 'safety-protocols']
})

// Assess competency at a milestone
await training.assessCompetency({
  traineeId: trainee.id,
  competency: 'residential-wiring',
  method: 'practical-demonstration',
  result: 'proficient',
  assessor: 'emp-4410'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify department when trainee completes program
training.trainingCompleted(async ({ traineeId, program, certificationDate }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'department-manager',
    message: `Trainee ${traineeId} completed ${program} on ${certificationDate}`
  })
})

// Auto-schedule feedback when competency assessment fails
training.competencyAssessed(async ({ traineeId, competency, result }) => {
  if (result === 'not-yet-competent') {
    await training.provideFeedback({
      traineeId,
      topic: competency,
      type: 'remediation-plan',
      scheduledDate: addDays(new Date(), 7)
    })
  }
})
```
