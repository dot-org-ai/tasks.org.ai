## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { superviseMaintenanceWorkers } from '@headlessly/supervise-maintenance-workers'

const maintenance = superviseMaintenanceWorkers()

// Assign a work order to a technician
const assignment = await maintenance.assignWorkOrder({
  workOrderId: 'WO-2026-0412',
  technicianId: 'TECH-087',
  priority: 'high',
  location: 'Building A - HVAC Unit 3',
  estimatedHours: 4
})

// Schedule preventive maintenance
await maintenance.schedulePreventiveMaintenance({
  equipmentId: 'EQ-1120',
  frequency: 'monthly',
  nextDueDate: '2026-03-01',
  assignedCrew: ['TECH-087', 'TECH-092']
})

// Inspect completed work
const inspection = await maintenance.inspectCompletedWork({
  workOrderId: 'WO-2026-0412',
  inspectorId: 'LEAD-005',
  checklistItems: ['functionality', 'cleanliness', 'safety']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify supervisor when safety violations occur
maintenance.safetyViolationReported(async ({ workerId, location, description }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'maintenance-supervisor',
    message: `Safety violation reported at ${location}: ${description}`
  })
  await maintenance.conductSafetyBriefing({
    location,
    attendees: [workerId],
    topic: description
  })
})

// Escalate when equipment downtime exceeds threshold
maintenance.equipmentDowntimeExceeded(async ({ equipmentId, hoursDown }) => {
  if (hoursDown > 24) {
    await escalate({
      to: 'facilities-director',
      message: `Equipment ${equipmentId} has been down for ${hoursDown} hours`
    })
  }
})
```
