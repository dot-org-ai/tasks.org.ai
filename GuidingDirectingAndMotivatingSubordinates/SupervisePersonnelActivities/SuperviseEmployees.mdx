### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { superviseEmployees } from '@headlessly/supervise-employees'

const supervision = superviseEmployees()

// Assign a project to a team member
const assignment = await supervision.assignWork({
  employeeId: 'emp-2847',
  task: 'Complete quarterly inventory audit',
  priority: 'high',
  dueDate: '2026-03-15'
})

// Monitor performance against objectives
const metrics = await supervision.monitorPerformance({
  employeeId: 'emp-2847',
  period: 'Q1-2026',
  objectives: ['inventory-accuracy', 'report-timeliness']
})

// Conduct a formal review
await supervision.conductReview({
  employeeId: 'emp-2847',
  period: 'Q1-2026',
  rating: 'meets-expectations',
  notes: 'Consistently meets deadlines with accurate reporting'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert supervisor when performance drops
supervision.performanceThresholdBreached(async ({ employeeId, metric, value }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'supervisor',
    message: `Employee ${employeeId} below threshold on ${metric}: ${value}`
  })
})

// Auto-schedule coaching after corrective action
supervision.correctiveActionIssued(async ({ employeeId, actionType }) => {
  await supervision.provideCoaching({
    employeeId,
    type: 'follow-up',
    scheduledDate: addDays(new Date(), 14)
  })
})
```
