# Supervise Scientific Technical Personnel

> Business-as-Code definition for supervising scientific and technical personnel. Models the oversight of researchers, lab technicians, and scientific staff including research project management, lab safety, protocol compliance, and publication coordination.

## Overview

Supervising scientific and technical personnel involves directing researchers, laboratory technicians, data analysts, and field scientists who conduct experiments, analyze data, and produce research findings. This definition covers research project assignment, laboratory safety enforcement, protocol adherence, equipment management, grant compliance, and scientific output tracking to ensure rigorous, reproducible, and timely research outcomes.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { superviseScientificTechnicalPersonnel } from '@headlessly/supervise-scientific-technical-personnel'

const science = superviseScientificTechnicalPersonnel()

// Assign a research task to a team member
const task = await science.assignResearchTask({
  projectId: 'GRANT-NIH-2026-0412',
  researcherId: 'RS-023',
  taskDescription: 'Conduct dose-response assay on compound XR-7',
  protocol: 'PROT-042',
  deadline: '2026-04-30'
})

// Review experimental results
const review = await science.reviewExperimentalResults({
  experimentId: 'EXP-2026-1105',
  reviewerId: 'PI-005',
  criteria: ['statistical-significance', 'reproducibility', 'data-integrity']
})

// Track grant spending
const budget = await science.trackGrantSpending({
  grantId: 'GRANT-NIH-2026-0412',
  period: 'Q1-2026',
  categories: ['personnel', 'supplies', 'equipment', 'travel']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify PI when experiment results are ready for review
science.experimentCompleted(async ({ experimentId, projectId, researcher }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'principal-investigator',
    message: `Experiment ${experimentId} on project ${projectId} completed by ${researcher}`
  })
})

// Alert when grant spending approaches budget limits
science.grantMilestoneReached(async ({ grantId, milestone, remainingBudget }) => {
  if (remainingBudget.percentage < 20) {
    await notify({
      to: 'grants-office',
      message: `Grant ${grantId} has only ${remainingBudget.percentage}% budget remaining`
    })
  }
})
```
