## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { superviseMedicalSupportPersonnel } from '@headlessly/supervise-medical-support-personnel'

const medSupport = superviseMedicalSupportPersonnel()

// Verify staff credentials before task assignment
const credCheck = await medSupport.verifyCredentials({
  staffId: 'MA-034',
  requiredCredentials: ['CMA', 'BLS', 'phlebotomy-cert'],
  asOfDate: '2026-03-15'
})

// Delegate a clinical task
await medSupport.delegateClinicalTask({
  taskType: 'phlebotomy',
  staffId: 'MA-034',
  patientId: 'PT-8821',
  orderingPhysician: 'DR-112',
  urgency: 'routine'
})

// Conduct a quality review
const review = await medSupport.conductQualityReview({
  department: 'clinical-lab',
  period: 'Q1-2026',
  metrics: ['turnaround-time', 'specimen-rejection-rate', 'critical-value-reporting']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert supervisor when credentials are about to expire
medSupport.credentialExpiring(async ({ staffId, credential, expirationDate }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'clinical-supervisor',
    message: `${credential} for staff ${staffId} expires on ${expirationDate}`
  })
})

// Trigger compliance audit when gaps are identified
medSupport.complianceGapIdentified(async ({ department, requirement, severity }) => {
  if (severity === 'critical') {
    await medSupport.auditComplianceChecklist({
      department,
      scope: 'full',
      dueDate: '2026-04-01'
    })
    await escalate({
      to: 'compliance-officer',
      message: `Critical compliance gap in ${department}: ${requirement}`
