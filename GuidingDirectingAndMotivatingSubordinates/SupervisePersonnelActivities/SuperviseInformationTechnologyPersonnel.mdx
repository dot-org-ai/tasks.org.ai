# Supervise Information Technology Personnel

> Business-as-Code definition for supervising IT staff including developers, system administrators, network engineers, and support technicians. Models sprint management, incident response oversight, and technical skill development.

## Overview

Supervising information technology personnel involves managing technical teams responsible for software development, infrastructure operations, cybersecurity, and IT support. Supervisors coordinate sprint planning, monitor system uptime and incident response, conduct code and architecture reviews, manage on-call rotations, and ensure staff maintain current certifications in rapidly evolving technology domains. This definition provides actions for IT workforce management across development and operations functions.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { superviseInformationTechnologyPersonnel } from '@headlessly/supervise-information-technology-personnel'

const it = superviseInformationTechnologyPersonnel()

// Plan a sprint
const sprint = await it.planSprint({
  teamId: 'platform-engineering',
  sprintNumber: 14,
  startDate: '2026-02-10',
  endDate: '2026-02-21',
  goals: ['deploy-auth-service-v2', 'resolve-database-latency-issues'],
  capacity: { totalPoints: 42 }
})

// Allocate staff to projects
await it.allocateToProject({
  staffId: 'dev-2201',
  projectId: 'auth-service-migration',
  allocation: 0.8,
  role: 'backend-engineer',
  sprint: sprint.id
})

// Manage on-call rotation
await it.manageOnCallRotation({
  teamId: 'platform-engineering',
  week: '2026-W07',
  primary: 'dev-2201',
  secondary: 'dev-2205',
  escalation: 'tech-lead-1100'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on incident escalation
it.incidentEscalated(async ({ incidentId, severity, service, assignee }) => {
  if (severity === 'P1') {
    await notify({
      to: ['it-manager', 'incident-commander'],
      priority: 'critical',
      message: `P1 incident on ${service}: ${incidentId}`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-schedule training when certification expiring
it.certificationExpiring(async ({ staffId, certification, expirationDate }) => {
  await it.trackCertifications({
    staffId,
    action: 'schedule-renewal',
    certification,
    deadline: expirationDate
  })
})
```
