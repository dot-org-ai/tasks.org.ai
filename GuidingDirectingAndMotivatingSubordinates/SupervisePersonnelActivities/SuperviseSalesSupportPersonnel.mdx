# Supervise Sales Support Personnel

> Business-as-Code definition for supervising sales representatives and customer support staff. Models quota management, pipeline oversight, support ticket escalation, and team performance tracking.

## Overview

Supervising sales and support personnel involves managing teams responsible for revenue generation and customer retention. Sales supervisors set quotas, monitor pipeline activity, coach representatives on closing techniques, and coordinate with marketing on lead quality. Support supervisors manage ticket queues, ensure service level agreements are met, and handle escalated customer issues. This definition provides actions for both sales and support oversight within a unified supervisory framework.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { superviseSalesSupportPersonnel } from '@headlessly/supervise-sales-support-personnel'

const sales = superviseSalesSupportPersonnel()

// Set quarterly quotas
await sales.setQuota({
  representativeId: 'rep-112',
  period: 'Q1-2026',
  target: { revenue: 250000, meetings: 40, closedDeals: 8 }
})

// Review team pipeline
const pipeline = await sales.reviewPipeline({
  teamId: 'enterprise-sales',
  stages: ['discovery', 'proposal', 'negotiation', 'closed-won'],
  period: 'Q1-2026'
})

// Monitor support ticket queue
const queue = await sales.monitorTicketQueue({
  queue: 'tier-1-support',
  slaThreshold: { responseMinutes: 30, resolutionHours: 4 }
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on SLA breach
sales.slaBreached(async ({ ticketId, agent, metric, threshold }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'support-supervisor',
    priority: 'high',
    message: `SLA breach on ticket ${ticketId}: ${metric} exceeded ${threshold}`
  })
  await sales.escalateTicket({ ticketId, reason: 'sla-breach' })
})

// Auto-generate weekly scorecards
sales.scorecardGenerated(async ({ teamId, period, results }) => {
  const underperformers = results.filter(r => r.attainment < 0.7)
  for (const rep of underperformers) {
    await sales.coachRepresentative({
      representativeId: rep.id,
      focus: 'quota-attainment',
      scheduledDate: nextBusinessDay()
    })
  }
})
```
