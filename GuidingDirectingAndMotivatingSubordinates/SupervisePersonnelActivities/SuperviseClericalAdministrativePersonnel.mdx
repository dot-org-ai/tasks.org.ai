```typescript
import { superviseClericalAdministrativePersonnel } from '@headlessly/supervise-clerical-administrative-personnel'

const admin = superviseClericalAdministrativePersonnel()

// Assign an administrative task
const task = await admin.assignAdministrativeTask({
  description: 'Prepare quarterly board meeting packets',
  assigneeId: 'AA-012',
  priority: 'high',
  dueDate: '2026-03-20',
  template: 'board-meeting-packet'

  documentId: 'DOC-2026-0445',
  reviewerId: 'OM-003',
  criteria: ['formatting', 'accuracy', 'completeness', 'branding']
})

// Manage office inventory
await admin.manageOfficeInventory({
  action: 'reorder',
  items: [
    { sku: 'PAPER-A4', currentStock: 5, reorderQuantity: 50 },
    { sku: 'TONER-BLK', currentStock: 1, reorderQuantity: 10 }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Auto-reorder when supplies run low
admin.inventoryLow(async ({ item, currentStock, reorderThreshold }) => {
  await admin.manageOfficeInventory({
    action: 'reorder',
    items: [{ sku: item.sku, currentStock, reorderQuantity: item.defaultOrderQuantity }]
  })
  await notify({
    to: 'office-manager',
    message: `Auto-reorder placed for ${item.name} (stock: ${currentStock})`
  })
})

// Redistribute work when task backlogs develop
admin.taskAssigned(async ({ assigneeId }) => {
  const workload = await admin.getStaffWorkload({ staffId: assigneeId })
  if (workload.pendingTasks > 15) {
    await notify({
      to: 'office-manager',
      message: `Staff ${assigneeId} has ${workload.pendingTasks} pending tasks - consider redistribution`
