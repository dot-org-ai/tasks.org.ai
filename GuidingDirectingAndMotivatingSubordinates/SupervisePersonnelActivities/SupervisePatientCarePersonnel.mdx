## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { supervisePatientCarePersonnel } from '@headlessly/supervise-patient-care-personnel'

const patientCare = supervisePatientCarePersonnel()

// Create a shift schedule for the medical-surgical unit
const schedule = await patientCare.createShiftSchedule({
  unit: 'Med-Surg 3A',
  shiftDate: '2026-03-15',
  shifts: [
    { type: 'day', staff: ['RN-112', 'RN-118', 'CNA-045'] },
    { type: 'evening', staff: ['RN-103', 'RN-125', 'CNA-052'] },
    { type: 'night', staff: ['RN-109', 'CNA-061'] }
  ]
})

// Assign patient loads based on acuity
await patientCare.assignPatientLoad({
  shift: 'day',
  unit: 'Med-Surg 3A',
  assignments: [
    { nurseId: 'RN-112', patientIds: ['PT-4401', 'PT-4402', 'PT-4403'] },
    { nurseId: 'RN-118', patientIds: ['PT-4404', 'PT-4405', 'PT-4406'] }
  ]
})

// Conduct supervisory rounds
const rounds = await patientCare.conductRounds({
  unit: 'Med-Surg 3A',
  supervisorId: 'NM-008',
  checkpoints: ['medication-administration', 'fall-precautions', 'hand-hygiene']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert when staffing falls below required ratios
patientCare.staffingShortageDetected(async ({ unit, currentRatio, requiredRatio }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'nurse-manager',
    message: `Staffing shortage on ${unit}: ratio ${currentRatio} below required ${requiredRatio}`
  })
  await patientCare.adjustStaffingLevel({
    unit,
    requestType: 'float-pool',
    urgency: 'immediate'
  })
})

// Trigger review when incident is reported
patientCare.incidentReported(async ({ incidentId, unit, severity }) => {
  if (severity === 'critical') {
    await escalate({
      to: 'chief-nursing-officer',
      message: `Critical incident ${incidentId} reported on ${unit}`
    })
  }
})
```
