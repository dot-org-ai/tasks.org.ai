# Supervise Student Research Internship Work

> Business-as-Code definition for supervising student research projects and internship work within academic, corporate, or government settings. Models project assignment, milestone reviews, academic compliance, and final evaluation workflows.

## Overview

Supervising student research and internship work involves guiding undergraduate, graduate, or post-doctoral students through structured research projects or professional internship experiences. Supervisors define project scope, set milestones aligned with academic requirements, provide mentorship on research methodology, review deliverables, evaluate student performance, and coordinate with academic institutions to ensure credit and compliance requirements are met. This definition provides actions for managing the complete student engagement lifecycle.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { superviseStudentResearchInternshipWork } from '@headlessly/supervise-student-research-internship-work'

const research = superviseStudentResearchInternshipWork()

// Define a research project
const project = await research.defineProject({
  studentId: 'stu-2026-0415',
  title: 'Machine Learning Approaches to Protein Folding Prediction',
  objectives: ['replicate-baseline', 'implement-novel-architecture', 'benchmark-results'],
  term: 'Spring-2026',
  institution: 'MIT Department of Biological Engineering'
})

// Assign a lab mentor
await research.assignMentor({
  projectId: project.id,
  mentorId: 'researcher-812',
  role: 'day-to-day technical guidance on ML pipeline development'
})

// Set milestones with deliverables
await research.setMilestone({
  projectId: project.id,
  milestones: [
    { name: 'Literature Review', dueDate: '2026-03-01', deliverable: 'annotated-bibliography' },
    { name: 'Baseline Replication', dueDate: '2026-04-01', deliverable: 'technical-report' },
    { name: 'Final Defense', dueDate: '2026-05-15', deliverable: 'thesis-presentation' }
  ]
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify academic advisor on milestone completion
research.milestoneReached(async ({ projectId, studentId, milestone }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'academic-advisor',
    message: `Student ${studentId} reached milestone: ${milestone.name} for project ${projectId}`
  })
})

// Auto-schedule guidance when deliverable needs revision
research.deliverableReviewed(async ({ studentId, deliverable, status }) => {
  if (status === 'revision-required') {
    await research.provideGuidance({
      studentId,
      topic: deliverable.name,
      type: 'revision-meeting',
      scheduledDate: addDays(new Date(), 3)
    })
  }
})
```
