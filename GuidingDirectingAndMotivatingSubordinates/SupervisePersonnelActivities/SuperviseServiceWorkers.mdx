## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { superviseServiceWorkers } from '@headlessly/supervise-service-workers'

const services = superviseServiceWorkers()

// Conduct pre-shift briefing
await services.conductBriefing({
  shift: 'morning',
  location: 'Main Dining Hall',
  topics: ['new menu items', 'VIP reservation at 12:30', 'health inspection tomorrow'],
  attendees: ['sw-101', 'sw-102', 'sw-103', 'sw-104']
})

// Assign workers to stations
await services.assignShift({
  date: '2026-02-05',
  shift: 'morning',
  assignments: [
    { workerId: 'sw-101', station: 'front-counter' },
    { workerId: 'sw-102', station: 'kitchen-prep' },
    { workerId: 'sw-103', station: 'dining-floor' }

})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert supervisor on failed inspection
services.workAreaInspected(async ({ area, passed, findings }) => {
  if (!passed) {
    await notify({
      to: 'service-supervisor',
      priority: 'high',
      message: `${area} failed inspection: ${findings.join(', ')}`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-document pattern of complaints
services.escalationHandled(async ({ workerId, complaintType }) => {
  const recent = await services.getOpenComplaints({ workerId, days: 30 })
  if (recent.length >= 3) {
    await services.documentIncident({
      workerId,
      type: 'recurring-complaint-pattern',
      details: `${recent.length} complaints in 30 days for ${complaintType}`
    })
