## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { manageBudgetsPersonalServicesOperations } from '@headlessly/manage-budgets-personal-services-operations'

const budgets = manageBudgetsPersonalServicesOperations()

// Create the quarterly operating budget
const budget = await budgets.createOperatingBudget({
  location: 'Downtown Wellness Spa',
  period: { start: '2026-04-01', end: '2026-06-30' },
  totalBudget: 185000
})

// Allocate staffing budget across roles
await budgets.allocateStaffingBudget({
  budgetId: budget.id,
  allocations: [
    { role: 'MassageTherapist', amount: 62000 },
    { role: 'Esthetician', amount: 45000 },
    { role: 'FrontDesk', amount: 28000 }
  ]
})

// Review current profit margins
const margins = await budgets.reviewProfitMargins({
  budgetId: budget.id,
  period: 'April'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert when profit margins drop below threshold
budgets.profitMarginReviewed(async ({ budgetId, margin }) => {
  if (margin.percentage < 20) {
    await notify({
      to: 'operations-manager',
      message: `Profit margin for ${margin.period} is ${margin.percentage}% - below 20% target`
    })
  }
})

// Auto-reorder supplies when expense tracking shows low inventory spend
budgets.supplyExpenseRecorded(async ({ budgetId, category, amountRemaining }) => {
  if (amountRemaining < 500) {
    await notify({
      to: 'supply-manager',
      message: `Supply budget for ${category} nearly exhausted - ${amountRemaining} remaining`
    })
