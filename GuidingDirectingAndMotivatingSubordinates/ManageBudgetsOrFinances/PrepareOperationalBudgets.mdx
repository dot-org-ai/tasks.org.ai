# Prepare Operational Budgets

> Business-as-Code definition for preparing operational budgets. Models the process of forecasting revenues and expenses, building departmental budgets, consolidating into an organization-wide operating plan, and gaining executive approval.

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { prepareOperationalBudgets } from '@headlessly/prepare-operational-budgets'

const budgets = prepareOperationalBudgets()

// Distribute templates to all departments
const distribution = await budgets.distributeBudgetTemplates({
  fiscalYear: 2027,
  departments: ['Sales', 'Engineering', 'Marketing', 'Operations', 'HR', 'Finance'],
  deadline: '2026-10-15',
  templateVersion: 'v2027'
})

// Consolidate all departmental submissions
const consolidated = await budgets.consolidateBudgets({
  fiscalYear: 2027,
  includeRevenue: true,
  includeCapex: false,
  escalationFactor: 1.035
})

// Present the finalized budget for approval
await budgets.presentForApproval({
  budgetId: consolidated.id,
  presenter: 'cfo',
  meetingDate: '2026-11-20',
  supportingDocuments: ['revenue-assumptions', 'headcount-plan', 'variance-analysis']
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Remind departments of upcoming submission deadline
budgets.budgetTemplatesDistributed(async ({ departments, deadline }) => {
  const reminderDate = new Date(deadline)
  reminderDate.setDate(reminderDate.getDate() - 7)
  await schedule({
    date: reminderDate.toISOString(),
    action: 'send-reminder',
    to: departments,
    message: `Budget submissions due in 7 days - deadline: ${deadline}`
  })
})

// Notify departments when final budget is locked
budgets.budgetFinalized(async ({ fiscalYear, departments }) => {
  for (const dept of departments) {
    await notify({
      to: `${dept.toLowerCase()}-manager`,
      message: `FY${fiscalYear} operational budget has been finalized and is now available in the budget system`
