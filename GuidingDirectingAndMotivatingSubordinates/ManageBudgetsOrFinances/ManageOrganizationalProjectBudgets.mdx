# Manage Organizational Project Budgets

> Business-as-Code definition for managing organizational or project budgets. Models the complete budget lifecycle from planning through allocation, monitoring, and close-out for both organizational operating budgets and project-specific financial plans.

## Overview

Managing organizational or project budgets involves developing, approving, executing, and controlling financial plans that govern how funds are allocated and spent across departments and projects. Budget managers establish spending authority, track actuals against approved amounts, analyze variances, and implement corrective measures to keep spending within approved limits. This activity bridges strategic financial planning with tactical execution, ensuring resources are consumed efficiently and in alignment with organizational goals.

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { manageOrganizationalProjectBudgets } from '@headlessly/manage-organizational-project-budgets'

const budgets = manageOrganizationalProjectBudgets()

// Create a new project budget
const budget = await budgets.createBudget({
  name: 'ERP System Implementation',
  type: 'project',
  period: { start: '2026-03-01', end: '2027-02-28' },
  totalAmount: 2400000
})

// Allocate funds across project phases
await budgets.allocateFunds({
  budgetId: budget.id,
  allocations: [
    { category: 'Discovery and Planning', amount: 320000 },
    { category: 'Software Licensing', amount: 600000 },
    { category: 'Implementation Services', amount: 950000 },
    { category: 'Training and Change Management', amount: 280000 },
    { category: 'Contingency', amount: 250000 }
  ]
})

// Review spending at the quarterly checkpoint
const review = await budgets.reviewSpending({
  budgetId: budget.id,
  asOfDate: '2026-06-30',
  groupBy: 'category'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert on significant variance
budgets.varianceDetected(async ({ budgetId, lineItem, variance }) => {
  if (Math.abs(variance.percentage) > 15) {
    await notify({
      to: 'budget-manager',
      message: `Budget variance of ${variance.percentage}% on ${lineItem} in budget ${budgetId}`
    })
  }
})

// Archive budget data when period closes
budgets.budgetClosed(async ({ budgetId, finalActuals, totalBudget }) => {
  await archive({
    budgetId,
    utilization: (finalActuals / totalBudget * 100).toFixed(1) + '%',
    closedDate: new Date().toISOString()
  })
})
```
