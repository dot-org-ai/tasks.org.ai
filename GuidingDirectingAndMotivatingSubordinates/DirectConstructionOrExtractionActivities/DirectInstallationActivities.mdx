# Direct Installation Activities

> Business-as-Code definition for directing installation activities. Models the planning, supervision, and quality assurance of installing systems, equipment, and components across building trades and industrial settings.

## Overview

Directing installation activities involves overseeing the placement, connection, and commissioning of mechanical, electrical, plumbing, HVAC, telecommunications, and specialty systems within structures or facilities. This includes reviewing installation plans, assigning installation crews, verifying compliance with manufacturer specifications and building codes, and managing the testing and handoff of installed systems. The definition supports installation managers, trade supervisors, and facilities teams in delivering properly installed and functioning systems.

## Actors

## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { directInstallationActivities } from '@headlessly/direct-installation-activities'

const installations = directInstallationActivities()

// Review the HVAC installation plan for a commercial building
const plan = await installations.reviewInstallationPlan({
  systemType: 'HVAC',
  building: 'Corporate Tower B',
  floors: [1, 2, 3, 4],
  specifications: 'carrier-rooftop-unit-50xc'
})

// Assign qualified installers
await installations.assignInstallers({
  planId: plan.id,
  technicians: [
    { id: 'tech-042', trade: 'hvac', certification: 'epa-608-universal' },
    { id: 'tech-078', trade: 'hvac', certification: 'epa-608-universal' }
  ],
  startDate: '2026-05-12'
})

// Commission the system after installation
const report = await installations.commissionSystem({
  planId: plan.id,
  tests: ['airflow-balance', 'refrigerant-charge', 'controls-sequence'],
  inspector: 'commissioning-agent-01'
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Notify end user when system is ready for handoff
installations.systemCommissioned(async ({ planId, systemType, building }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'facilities-manager',
    message: `${systemType} system in ${building} commissioned and ready for operations handoff`
  })
})

// Auto-register warranty upon completion
installations.installationCompleted(async ({ equipmentId, manufacturer }) => {
  await installations.documentAsBuilt({ equipmentId })
  await registerWarranty({
    equipmentId,
    manufacturer,
    activationDate: new Date().toISOString()
  })
})
```
