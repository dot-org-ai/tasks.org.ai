## Usage

### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { directConstructionExtractionPersonnel } from '@headlessly/direct-construction-extraction-personnel'

const personnel = directConstructionExtractionPersonnel()

// Verify worker certifications before shift
const verified = await personnel.verifyCertifications({
  crewId: 'steel-crew-alpha',
  requiredCerts: ['ironworker-journeyman', 'osha-30', 'fall-protection']
})

// Conduct morning safety briefing
await personnel.conductSafetyBriefing({
  crewId: 'steel-crew-alpha',
  topic: 'Fall protection and steel erection hazards',
  date: '2026-04-14',
  attendees: verified.members
})

// Assign tasks for the day
await personnel.assignTask({
  crewId: 'steel-crew-alpha',
  description: 'Erect structural steel columns - Grid D through G, Level 3',
  priority: 'high',
  estimatedHours: 8
})
```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Escalate safety incidents immediately
personnel.incidentReported(async ({ incidentId, severity, siteId }) => {
  if (severity === 'serious') {
    await notify({
      to: ['safety-manager', 'project-director'],
      message: `Serious incident reported at site ${siteId}. Immediate review required.`
    })
    await pauseOperations({ siteId, reason: incidentId })
  }
})

// Flag expired certifications
personnel.certificationVerified(async ({ crewMemberId, expiring }) => {
  if (expiring.length > 0) {
    await notify({
      to: 'labor-coordinator',
      message: `${crewMemberId} has ${expiring.length} certifications expiring within 30 days`
    })
  }
})
```
