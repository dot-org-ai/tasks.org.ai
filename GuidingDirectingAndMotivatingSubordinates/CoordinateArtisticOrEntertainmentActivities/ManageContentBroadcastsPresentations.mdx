### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { manageContentBroadcastsPresentations } from '@headlessly/manage-content-broadcasts-presentations'

const broadcast = manageContentBroadcastsPresentations()

// Curate the evening program lineup
await broadcast.curateProgramLineup({
  channel: 'main-broadcast',
  date: '2026-05-15',
  daypart: 'primetime',
  programs: [
    { slot: '20:00', title: 'Evening News Hour', duration: '60-minutes' },
    { slot: '21:00', title: 'Documentary Series: Climate Futures', duration: '60-minutes' },
    { slot: '22:00', title: 'Late Night Interview', duration: '60-minutes' }
  ]
})

// Assemble a live show rundown
await broadcast.assembleRundown({
  program: 'Evening News Hour',
  date: '2026-05-15',
  segments: [
    { order: 1, title: 'Top Stories', duration: '12-minutes', anchor: 'primary' },
    { order: 2, title: 'Weather Forecast', duration: '4-minutes', anchor: 'weather' },

```

### Event-Driven Automation

```typescript
// Alert when content is flagged during review
broadcast.contentFlagged(async ({ assetId, title, issue, severity }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'standards-editor',
    message: `Content flagged: "${title}" - ${issue} (severity: ${severity}). Review required before air.`
  })
})

// Auto-generate broadcast log after programming airs
broadcast.broadcastLogGenerated(async ({ channel, date, programs }) => {
  await notify({
    to: 'program-scheduler',
    message: `Broadcast log for ${channel} on ${date} finalized. ${programs.length} programs logged.`
  })
})
```
