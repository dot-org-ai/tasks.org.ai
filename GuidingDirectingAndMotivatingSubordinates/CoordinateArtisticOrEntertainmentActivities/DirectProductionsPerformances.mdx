### Calling Actions

```typescript
import { directProductionsPerformances } from '@headlessly/direct-productions-performances'

const production = directProductionsPerformances()

// Cast a production
const cast = await production.castProduction({
  show: 'A Midsummer Nights Dream',
  roles: [
    { role: 'Titania', auditionSlots: 12, callbackDate: '2026-03-15' },
    { role: 'Oberon', auditionSlots: 10, callbackDate: '2026-03-15' },
    { role: 'Puck', auditionSlots: 15, callbackDate: '2026-03-16' }
  ],
  auditionDates: ['2026-03-10', '2026-03-11', '2026-03-12']
})

// Build technical cues
await production.buildTechnicalCues({
  show: 'A Midsummer Nights Dream',
  act: 1,
  cues: [
    { number: 'LX-101', type: 'lighting', action: 'fade-to-blue-wash', trigger: 'Titania-entrance' },

      to: member.performer,
      message: `Congratulations! You have been cast as ${member.role} in "${show}". First rehearsal details to follow.`
    })

  await notify({
    to: 'director',
    message: `Opening night of "${show}" complete. Attendance: ${attendance}. Technical issues: ${technicalIssues.length}.`
